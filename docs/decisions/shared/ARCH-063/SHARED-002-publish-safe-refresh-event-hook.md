# Publish safe refresh event hook

## Architecture
ARCH-063; docs/architecture/ARCH-063-refreshable-shopify-status-and-safe-refresh-events.md. Coordinator moda_architect.

## Objective
Publish safe refresh event hook using existing automatic coordinated refresh.

## Context
Metadata EXPIRED blocks authoring despite usable refresh; no safe refresh lifecycle events. Parent includes cross-service source audit and selected solution.

## Scope
moda-interact-shared implementation/tests at exact touchpoints below; stale shared checkout is not a deployed observation.

| Existing file | Exact surface | Required change |
|---|---|---|
| moda-interact-shared/package.json | version/export release metadata | Publish accepted compatible version, record exact immutable receipt/exports; no implementation revalidation. |


## Out of Scope
Page-render refresh, manual credential entry, lock/recovery redesign, schema, topology, generic logger/metric framework and automatic task execution.

## Requirements
## Problem and audited behavior
Commerce src/studio/connections/provider-status.ts readProviderMetadata checks valid access then expired access and emits EXPIRED without checking usable refresh credentials. store-integration.tsx and provider-tool-handoff.ts permit AVAILABLE only, so users cannot reach the already automatic execution refresh. Selector components/studio-selected-shop-context.tsx renders an existence-only shopifyOfflineSessionAvailable boolean even for Woo. Existing expired-status tests encode this dead end. App shop.service.ts readiness near128–136 accepts refreshToken presence without refreshTokenExpires, giving the opposite false-positive. Shared offline-token-provider has coordinated refresh mechanics but no refresh events. These are local implementation observations, not deployed-state claims.

Canonical ARCH-061-MCP-001 implementation worktree session-reader.ts calls provider.getSession(shopId) without a premature expiry gate; shared submodule checkout may show old direct reads and is not proof of deployed behavior. Background shopify-session.service.ts delegates Shared getAccessToken; no access-expiry admission gate found. Commerce execution composition/local-policy-providers already call Shared; App SDK wrapper handles token refresh inside transaction scope. Audit fixes below preserve existing accepted locking/identity/recovery rather than reimplementing it.

## Exact functional decision
Add Commerce-local StoreIntegrationStatus REFRESHABLE. Keep EXPIRED for unusable refresh-required credentials, with label "Refresh or reconnection required" so a within-skew access token is not falsely described already expired. Both status and App readiness use the current helper's fixed 320000ms skew, test boundaries at exactly now+320000 and +320001; do not revert to an assumed five-minute constant. For an authorized ACTIVE Shopify shop with exactly one matching offline session, metadata AVAILABLE means nonempty access present with null expiry with no refresh token (the helper-supported nonexpiring state) or expires>now+320000ms. Access inside the helper's actual 320000ms refresh skew, including expired access, with refreshToken present/nonempty and refreshTokenExpires>now is REFRESHABLE. Access requiring refresh without usable refresh is EXPIRED; absent offline/access is MISSING, ambiguous or invalid mapping UNKNOWN/unavailable. Query refresh presence using DB predicates and explicit safe selects; never select/return token or decrypt. No page render/status read/network mutation. Readiness means credentials can be attempted, never live provider health. Display REFRESHABLE as "Ready to refresh automatically" and "Credentials refresh when a tool runs" with existing "Live connection not checked". No user refresh button, credential edit or reinstall requirement for REFRESHABLE.

Allow both AVAILABLE and REFRESHABLE for Shopify tool-authoring link and native tool preselection; Woo retains AVAILABLE and existing grant checks. Use one local isStoreIntegrationUsableForAuthoring predicate in provider-tool-handoff.ts and reuse in StoreIntegration. Test/save/live-test actions MUST independently resolve current selected Shop and execute via Shared getSession/getAccessToken; do not authorize from stale browser status, skip scope checks or refresh on save if existing save is metadata-only. Refresh happens only at actual provider execution. A stale REFRESHABLE hint can fail safely if refresh is revoked; stale AVAILABLE can refresh at execution after expiry. Existing pending async shop-switch results must never reopen another shop's link.

Selector header must show provider-specific metadata state from the same safe classifier: remove existence-only boolean as decision source, replace ShopExecutionContext field with `storeIntegration:{platform:'SHOPIFY'|'WOOCOMMERCE';status:StoreIntegrationStatus}|null` as Commerce-local contract. The production projection reuses readProviderMetadata; injected test fixtures updated. No cross-service wire schema. Unknown/no selection stays explicit; Woo never labelled Shopify session. Header and Connections agree without live checks.

App readiness function must use same logical credential viability: nonexpiring access with no refresh token OR access valid beyond now+320000ms OR access requiring refresh with nonempty refresh and refresh expiry strictly future; missing/expired refresh expiry is false. This remains metadata-only and does not replace actual Shared execution validation. Shared helper invalid-token semantics remain unchanged. MCP/Background direct helper callers require no new optimistic expiry precheck.

## Exact safe refresh-event contract
Shared factory gains optional `onEvent?:(event:ShopifyOfflineRefreshEvent)=>void` hook, exported from ./shopify/node. Hook failure is swallowed synchronously; async return is ignored and rejection suppressed; telemetry never changes return/transaction outcome. Event is frozen plain bounded object `{event:'shopify.offline_refresh.started'|'shopify.offline_refresh.committed'|'shopify.offline_refresh.failed';operationId:string;shopId:string|null;source:'SHARED'|'SDK';durationMs:number;outcome:'STARTED'|'COMMITTED'|'REJECTED'|'UNKNOWN'|'CANCELLED'|'UNAVAILABLE';reasonCode:ShopifyOfflineTokenErrorCode|null}`. No domain, session ID, token, scope, error/cause/body, OAuth client key/secret, endpoint or customer fields. operationId is a fresh UUID per attempted refresh, not caller text; duration monotonic elapsed rounded/clamped 0..60000. shopId derives trusted context; SDK bootstrap uses null until resolved, never a guessed domain as identifier.

For Shared getSession: emit started immediately before actual refresh dispatch after all eligibility checks; emit committed ONLY after interactive transaction commits successfully; emit failed once on rejection, cancellation, timeout, malformed response or persistence/commit ambiguity after start. Unknown after remote acceptance maps UNKNOWN/REFRESH_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN, never committed. Returning existing valid/nonexpiring credential emits no refresh event. Lock waiter rereading committed token emits none. Hook is not a competing logger: each service adapter forwards schema fields to existing @modainteract/moda-interact-shared/logging logger, info started/committed, warn failed. No raw Error attached. Exactly one terminal event per started attempt within a running process; process death can leave started without terminal, do not claim durable/exactly-once telemetry.

SDK-managed refresh/token exchange is not observable solely from Shared getSession. App coordination wrapper tracks bounded OAuth request intent in its existing ALS context: grant_type refresh_token emits same SDK started event; successful SDK credential persistence does not yet emit committed. Emit SDK committed only after outer coordinated transaction commits (including authenticated redirect commit); rejection/rollback/deadline/commit failure emits SDK failed. Token exchange acquisition is a distinct operation and MUST NOT be mislabeled refresh: no refresh event unless grant_type refresh_token. If SDK delegates to Shared refresh, source SHARED owns events and wrapper emits no duplicate. App creates service-owned event adapter reusing same exported event shape; no generic logger fork. Tests cover SDK refresh/store-success/commit-failure and redirect handling.

## Package/dependency and rollout
Shared implementation extends existing API compatibly; publication chooses next available approved semver and records exact version before consumer pins. No forced version guess or unpublished sibling import. Commerce UI correction is independent and Ready now; it uses existing accepted ARCH-060/061/062 contracts, does not wait for log publication. Shared logging implementation is also independently Ready. Consumer event wiring depends on Shared publication. App wiring includes metadata-readiness correction. System Test is terminal on all fixes; manually invoked after optional user exercise. Compatible rollout, no schema/credential/env or Render topology change. Logging absent in old binaries is expected until owning consumer deployed; do not assert deployed observability from local code. No new metric/span framework. Metadata reads and tooling never expose provider secrets.

## Work Items
- [ ] Publish accepted compatible version, record exact immutable receipt/exports; no implementation revalidation.

## Interfaces / Contracts
Commerce-local REFRESHABLE DTO/predicate and selector metadata, plus published optional Shared onEvent hook and exact frozen event schema above. Each consumer owns safe logger forwarding; provider/runtime credentials stay server-only. Exact version recorded by SHARED-002 before consumer pins.

## Dependencies
- ARCH-063-SHARED-001

## Enables
- ARCH-063-SHOPIFY-001
- ARCH-063-BACKGROUND-001

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prerequisite Complete/accepted, exact approved version visible in registry with event type/export; metadata-only release diff.

## Validation
- [ ] Verify accepted Complete prerequisite, approved version, successful release and exact registry visibility; do not rerun implementation tests/lint/build/typecheck.
- [ ] Confirm release-only diff.

## Stop Condition
Complete defined work/criteria/validation, submit report for authorized review and STOP. Explicit developer completion required. System Test terminal/manually invoked; no enabled work auto-start.

## Implementation Notes
Execution ownership amendment (2026-11-06): developer explicitly requested agent implementation through `/moda-task ARCH-063-SHARED-002` and authorized task synchronization, claim, release-task changes and review publication. Delegate bounded publication to moda_shared through canonical launcher; retain completion_mode developer and all release-only constraints. No attempt, dependency or scope change.

Dependency reconciliation (2026-11-06): ARCH-063-SHARED-001 Attempt 1 is architect Accepted and explicitly developer-completed; publication task is now Ready, unclaimed at Attempt 0. No publication or implementation is started by this promotion.

Use launcher-resolved isolated/synchronized task worktrees when execution requested. No implementation from definition. Preserve accepted locking/domain/SDK identities. Task-specific assertions are binding; no architecture selection delegated. Service logger uses published Shared logging, never raw provider/Prisma Error.
