# Extract QueueMonitor summary polling hook

## Architecture

Architecture ID: `ARCH-025`

Architecture document: `docs/architecture/ARCH-025-shopify-billing-service-maintainability.md`

Coordinator: `moda_architect`

## Objective

Extract queue-summary snapshot/loading/error/refresh preference and single-flight polling lifecycle into a dedicated hook behind the accepted ADMIN-009 client boundary.

## Context

Summary refresh has distinct semantics from jobs/detail reads: immediate post-mount refresh, persisted interval, single-flight admission, last-good-snapshot retention, abort-safe errors and a successful-refresh callback that currently refreshes jobs when a queue is open.

## Scope

Authorised implementation surface:

```text
src/components/admin/queue-monitor.tsx
src/components/admin/queue-monitor/use-queue-monitor-summary.ts
tests/unit/queue-monitor-summary.test.ts
```

## Out of Scope

Jobs/detail/drawer/view extraction; changes to `queue-monitor.client.ts`, response types, refresh-option helper, accepted ADMIN-009 security loaders or server/API code.

## Requirements

### Common ARCH-025 QueueMonitor invariants

- This is a **move-only structural refactor**. Do not change QueueMonitor product behaviour, server authorization, Redis/BullMQ reads, HTTP response shapes, queue-job normalization/redaction, i18n/catalogue semantics or diagnostic exposure.
- Preserve `QueueMonitor` at `src/components/admin/queue-monitor.tsx` with the same exported name/caller boundary. Existing protected-page callers do not migrate.
- QueueMonitor remains strictly read-only. Do not add retry, requeue, delete, pause, resume or other mutation controls.
- Preserve the existing protected endpoints exactly: `/api/admin/queues`, `/api/admin/queues/jobs`, `/api/admin/queues/jobs/detail`. Do not change their routes, authorization ordering or response semantics.
- Preserve `src/lib/admin/queue-monitor.ts` as the canonical server reader/type owner. Browser modules must not import it at runtime; the client uses a bounded local mirror of the HTTP response shapes.
- Preserve `src/components/admin/queue-monitor-refresh.ts` as the canonical refresh-option/default/storage helper. Do not duplicate or change `REFRESH_OPTIONS`, `DEFAULT_REFRESH_MS`, `STORAGE_KEY`, `isRefreshValue()` or `getInitialRefreshMs()`.
- Preserve summary semantics: initial refresh is scheduled immediately after mount; at most one summary request is in flight; manual/poll attempts while one is running return without starting another; `cache: "no-store"`; aborts do not surface as data errors; failures retain the last successful snapshot; successful summary refresh clears the summary error and, when a queue is open, requests a jobs refresh.
- Preserve jobs semantics: stale requests abort on dependency changes; query keys remain `queue`, `status`, `shop`, `page`, `limit`, `direction`; recent mode uses limit `5`, full mode `10`; successful row replacement clears selected-job/detail state; non-abort failure sets jobs unavailable and clears the jobs snapshot.
- Preserve current state-transition asymmetries exactly: queue switch resets jobs/recent/page/error/selection/detail while retaining shop/status/direction filters and an already-open drawer width; Shop/Status changes explicitly prepare loading, reset page and clear selection/detail; Direction changes explicitly prepare loading/reset page but do not immediately clear selected detail; page changes and View all do not use the same explicit prepare-loading transition as filters.
- Preserve detail semantics: stale selections abort; detail query keys remain `queue`, `status`, `jobId`; HTTP 404 maps to `queue.jobGone`; other non-OK responses map to `queue.jobDetailsUnavailable`; aborts do not surface a user error.
- Preserve drawer semantics: first open starts maximized, switching queues while open preserves the current drawer width, close clears only selected queue/width/resizing (not stored jobs/detail), maximize sets width back to `null`, and pointer/keyboard resizing retains current bounds and ArrowLeft/ArrowRight/Home/End meanings.
- Preserve catalogue/i18n ownership: queue job names continue through `adminQueueJobLabel`, statuses through `adminStatusLabel`, dates/times through `adminI18n`, and no raw locale/currency formatting is introduced.
- Preserve bounded diagnostic presentation: selected detail may show the current normalized lifecycle fields, failed reason, stacktrace and normalized payload with copy controls; do not expose Redis/configuration credentials or additional raw provider/queue internals.
- Do not add a Redux/global state store, generic client data framework, generic HTTP framework or new React/browser test framework solely for this extraction.
- Keep tests honest: no skipped tests, weakened assertions or changed expected behaviour merely because code moved. `npm run test:unit`, `npm test` and production build must introduce no task regression.
- These server/API sources are frozen byte-for-byte throughout ADMIN-009..015: `src/lib/admin/queue-monitor.ts` (`f2270a0c76992059793ce1a3184b4e424675d8ea0dc2a3bbef03a0fadd202486`), `/api/admin/queues/route.ts` (`f0eaed7214b6d57341f37a04afcc6636efa325358c0ea62321b09c086c6df408`), `/api/admin/queues/jobs/route.ts` (`fd6413d4afd37a4c46208d397f9bc5903a0766a651866ba414acedb1b95368a7`), `/api/admin/queues/jobs/detail/route.ts` (`c367a8e6ac3674f54df815ee05ecfe682f65e7e5f8eb0f2feeff80a05b298bab`).
- These dedicated server/API tests are frozen byte-for-byte throughout ADMIN-009..015: `admin-queue-jobs.test.mjs` (`3bfc3954b2938ea6f7028f2db51cae26e943ea5d8845e1d7cab2eb87b96bd6bc`), `admin-queue-job-detail.test.mjs` (`e567406ccace44955ef9ff43c3e5b138e19f4be92677f13fd1e47d47ec3011e0`), `admin-failed-job-detail.test.mjs` (`da8dccc08b3981c45f39ca39cd0d6a0a98121e4f8b283c0cccb32db39a20e195`), `admin-failed-jobs.test.mjs` (`fad750721202bd646b13c1aba6c37464e0698618e6707775265f8fdb0f281609`).

### R1 — hook ownership

The hook owns `refreshMs`, summary `snapshot`, summary `error`, summary `loading`, summary request AbortController and single-flight admission. It exposes the accepted refresh selection plus a manual `refresh()` operation and accepts one bounded callback invoked only after a successful new snapshot has been accepted so the shell can preserve the current "selected queue => refresh jobs" coupling.

### R2 — exact polling lifecycle

Preserve mount `setTimeout(..., 0)`, unmount abort, localStorage write on refresh-value changes, `refreshMs === 0` meaning no interval, one interval otherwise, and the current no-overlap rule. Do not queue a second refresh behind an in-flight one.

### R3 — error/convergence semantics

Abort does not set an error. Non-abort failures set `queue.dataUnavailable` but retain the previous successful snapshot. Success replaces snapshot and clears the error. Loading is cleared exactly when the current admitted request finishes.

## Work Items

- [ ] Move summary state/request/polling lifecycle into the hook.
- [ ] Rewire QueueMonitor without changing selected-queue/jobs behaviour.
- [ ] Add focused tests for pure/request-state helpers used to implement single-flight/abort/convergence semantics without adding a React test framework.

## Interfaces / Contracts

ADMIN-010 consumes ADMIN-009 `queue-monitor.client.ts` and existing `queue-monitor-refresh.ts`. The hook interface becomes the accepted summary-control contract for later QueueMonitor tasks.

## Dependencies

- `ARCH-025-ADMIN-009`

## Enables

- `ARCH-025-ADMIN-011`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No summary fetch implementation remains duplicated in `queue-monitor.tsx`.
- [ ] Single-flight, immediate load, paused polling, preference persistence, abort and last-good-snapshot semantics are preserved.
- [ ] Successful summary refresh still triggers the shell callback used to refresh jobs for an open queue.
- [ ] Accepted ADMIN-009 browser client/types/security harness remain unchanged.

- [ ] The architect-accepted ADMIN-009 versions of `tests/security/admin-queue-monitor.test.mjs`, `tests/security/admin-queue-details-drawer.test.mjs`, `tests/security/admin-failed-job-detail-panel.test.mjs` and `tests/security/admin-internationalization.test.mjs` are unchanged.
