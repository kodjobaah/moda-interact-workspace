# Extract Usage events step

## Architecture

Architecture ID: `ARCH-025`

Architecture document: `docs/architecture/ARCH-025-shopify-billing-service-maintainability.md`

Coordinator: `moda_architect`

## Objective

Extract usage-event/tier presentation and local editing dispatch behind a focused child component while retaining canonical BuilderEvent helpers and navigation/economics ownership.

## Context

Step 3 contains the largest repeated form markup outside economics. The existing pure helpers already own add/move/update/tier transformations and serialization; the child should present/edit through those accepted controller actions rather than copy their logic.

## Scope

Authorised implementation surface:

```text
src/components/admin/merchant/merchant-pricing-plan-builder.tsx
src/components/admin/merchant/merchant-pricing-plan-builder/usage-events-step.tsx
```

Directly adjacent type-only files under `src/components/admin/merchant/merchant-pricing-plan-builder/` are permitted only when required to keep this bounded extraction coherent.

## Out of Scope

Rewriting BuilderEvent helpers, economics evaluation, Shopify pricing step, changing five-event limit or zero-cost policy.

## Requirements

### Common ARCH-025 Admin invariants

- This is a **move-only structural refactor**. Do not change pricing-plan product behaviour, payload semantics, economics policy, Merchant Knowledge rules, Commerce-model assignment meaning, translation requirements, server authorization, catalogue CAS semantics, audit semantics or durable persistence.
- Preserve `MerchantPricingPlanBuilder` at `src/components/admin/merchant/merchant-pricing-plan-builder.tsx` with the same exported name and prop contract (`plan`, `cataloguePlans`, `featureCatalogue`, `merchantKnowledgeSourceTypes`, `commerceModelOptions`, `minimumUpgradePremiumBps`). Existing callers do not migrate during this tranche.
- Preserve the form action `mutateMerchantPricingPlanAction` and hidden fields `intent`, `payload`, `translationJson`, `economicsOverrideRequested`, `economicsOverrideReason`. Do not change the server action in this tranche.
- Preserve the exact ordered seven-step labels: `Plan`, `Catalogue placement`, `Shopify pricing`, `Usage events`, `Merchant content`, `Portfolio economics`, `Translations & review`.
- Preserve navigation semantics: backward navigation is allowed; forward navigation may advance at most one step; step 3 blocks only for an unbounded zero-cost fixed usage event, step 4 blocks only for invalid merchant content, and step 5 blocks until economics passes or a valid allowed override is ready. Final submit remains stricter than navigation.
- Preserve create/edit placement semantics: create-time plan-kind changes recompute placement; edit-time plan-kind changes do not. For FREE submission, the payload recovery usage-event handle is `null` while the local draft retains the previous handle.
- Preserve economics override invalidation exactly: changing handle, credits, currency, recurring amount, effective placement, `minimumUpgradePremiumBps` or serialized usage events clears enabled override state. Commerce model, Merchant Knowledge fields, merchant description/highlights, admin reason and translation state do not currently participate in that invalidation key.
- Preserve Merchant Knowledge product policy: it remains included in submitted `supportedFeatureKeys` regardless of generic feature toggles; its configuration is separately validated with the Shared schema and only active purpose/data-format source options are offered.
- Preserve Commerce-model repair behaviour: `Use Platform default` maps to `null`; a saved currently-unavailable model remains present as `Current model unavailable — <id>` with the existing alert until the admin deliberately repairs it.
- Preserve translation semantics: retained translations depend on the current English description/highlights rules; `validTranslationJson()` continues preferring a valid workbook result, then retained template, then current/fresh template fallback. `MerchantPricingTranslationWorkbook` remains mounted across normal step navigation (hidden outside step 6), so uploaded workbook/file/error state is not discarded by Back/Next navigation.
- The typed reducer/controller manages local UI transitions only. Do not move or duplicate canonical payload validation, economics policy, translation validation or feature policy from existing modules under `src/lib/admin/merchant/`.
- Do not add a Redux/global store, form framework, generic UI plugin system or new React test framework solely for this extraction.
- Keep tests honest: no skipped tests, weakened assertions or changed expected behaviour merely because JSX/state moved. `npm run test:unit`, `npm test` and production build must introduce no task regression.
- Preserve these existing pure/domain test assets byte-for-byte throughout ADMIN-001..008:
  - `tests/unit/merchant-pricing-builder-payload.test.ts` — SHA-256 `a985f89cbc9f4d41901d2c1e400935faf8453a5bd866ac0834a58b0851feb243`

### R1 — complete usage-event presentation

Move step-3 markup for event count/add, labels/handles/credits/max uses, FIXED/GRADUATED/VOLUME modes, currency-aware prices, tiers, ordering and removal.

### R2 — canonical local operations

Continue using accepted controller actions backed by existing `createEmptyBuilderEvent`, `moveBuilderEvent`, `updateBuilderEvent`, `addBuilderTier`, `updateBuilderTier`, `serializeBuilderEvent`, `formatBuilderEventPrice` and zero-cost helpers. Preserve the maximum of five events and deterministic client-key generation semantics.

### R3 — gate stays outside presentation

The wizard controller remains owner of the step-3 forward gate (`events.some(hasUnboundedZeroCostFixedEvent)`). The child may display `ZERO_COST_USAGE_EVENT_MESSAGE` but must not redefine navigation or economics policy.

## Work Items

- [ ] Extract complete Usage events markup.
- [ ] Route edits through accepted controller actions/canonical helpers.
- [ ] Keep navigation/economics decisions outside the child.
- [ ] Run accepted security/controller/policy suites.

## Interfaces / Contracts

Repository-internal UI extraction only. Public contract remains `MerchantPricingPlanBuilder` at its existing module path and the existing `mutateMerchantPricingPlanAction` form submission contract. Canonical domain/policy modules are consumed rather than redefined.

## Dependencies

## Enables

## Stop Condition
