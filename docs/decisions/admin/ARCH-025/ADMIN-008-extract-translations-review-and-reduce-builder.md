# Extract Translations/review and reduce builder shell

## Architecture

Architecture ID: `ARCH-025`

Architecture document: `docs/architecture/ARCH-025-shopify-billing-service-maintainability.md`

Coordinator: `moda_architect`

## Objective

Extract the mounted translation-workbook/final-review/admin-reason/submit presentation and finish `MerchantPricingPlanBuilder` as a thin form/navigation/controller shell without changing submission behaviour.

## Context

The final step combines an always-mounted workbook, final summary, admin reason and submit control. Moving it last ensures every preceding screen already consumes the stable controller. This task must preserve workbook mount lifetime and hidden form payload ownership while reducing the public builder to orchestration.

## Scope

Authorised implementation surface:

```text
src/components/admin/merchant/merchant-pricing-plan-builder.tsx
src/components/admin/merchant/merchant-pricing-plan-builder/translations-review-step.tsx
```

Directly adjacent type-only files under `src/components/admin/merchant/merchant-pricing-plan-builder/` are permitted only when required to keep this bounded extraction coherent.

## Out of Scope

Changing `MerchantPricingTranslationWorkbook`, submit button implementation, translation schema/workbook parser, server action, economics policy or form payload contract.

## Requirements

### Common ARCH-025 Admin invariants

- This is a **move-only structural refactor**. Do not change pricing-plan product behaviour, payload semantics, economics policy, Merchant Knowledge rules, Commerce-model assignment meaning, translation requirements, server authorization, catalogue CAS semantics, audit semantics or durable persistence.
- Preserve `MerchantPricingPlanBuilder` at `src/components/admin/merchant/merchant-pricing-plan-builder.tsx` with the same exported name and prop contract (`plan`, `cataloguePlans`, `featureCatalogue`, `merchantKnowledgeSourceTypes`, `commerceModelOptions`, `minimumUpgradePremiumBps`). Existing callers do not migrate during this tranche.
- Preserve the form action `mutateMerchantPricingPlanAction` and hidden fields `intent`, `payload`, `translationJson`, `economicsOverrideRequested`, `economicsOverrideReason`. Do not change the server action in this tranche.
- Preserve the exact ordered seven-step labels: `Plan`, `Catalogue placement`, `Shopify pricing`, `Usage events`, `Merchant content`, `Portfolio economics`, `Translations & review`.
- Preserve navigation semantics: backward navigation is allowed; forward navigation may advance at most one step; step 3 blocks only for an unbounded zero-cost fixed usage event, step 4 blocks only for invalid merchant content, and step 5 blocks until economics passes or a valid allowed override is ready. Final submit remains stricter than navigation.
- Preserve create/edit placement semantics: create-time plan-kind changes recompute placement; edit-time plan-kind changes do not. For FREE submission, the payload recovery usage-event handle is `null` while the local draft retains the previous handle.
- Preserve economics override invalidation exactly: changing handle, credits, currency, recurring amount, effective placement, `minimumUpgradePremiumBps` or serialized usage events clears enabled override state. Commerce model, Merchant Knowledge fields, merchant description/highlights, admin reason and translation state do not currently participate in that invalidation key.
- Preserve Merchant Knowledge product policy: it remains included in submitted `supportedFeatureKeys` regardless of generic feature toggles; its configuration is separately validated with the Shared schema and only active purpose/data-format source options are offered.
- Preserve Commerce-model repair behaviour: `Use Platform default` maps to `null`; a saved currently-unavailable model remains present as `Current model unavailable — <id>` with the existing alert until the admin deliberately repairs it.
- Preserve translation semantics exactly: retained translations depend on the current English description/highlights rules; `validTranslationJson()` returns the raw `translationJson` when `translationResult?.valid`, otherwise an edit `retainedTemplate` when present, otherwise the existing non-empty raw `translationJson` unchanged, and only when that raw value is empty builds the fresh current template. `canSubmit` independently still requires retained translations or a valid translation result. `MerchantPricingTranslationWorkbook` remains mounted across normal step navigation (hidden outside step 6), so uploaded workbook/file/error state is not discarded by Back/Next navigation.
- The typed reducer/controller manages local UI transitions only. Do not move or duplicate canonical payload validation, economics policy, translation validation or feature policy from existing modules under `src/lib/admin/merchant/`.
- Do not add a Redux/global store, form framework, generic UI plugin system or new React test framework solely for this extraction.
- Keep tests honest: no skipped tests, weakened assertions or changed expected behaviour merely because JSX/state moved. `npm run test:unit`, `npm test` and production build must introduce no task regression.
- ADMIN-001 owns the accepted controller/action/selector contract. ADMIN-002..008 are consume-only presentation extractions and MUST NOT redesign or extend `merchant-pricing-plan-draft.ts` / `use-merchant-pricing-plan-draft.ts`. If an accepted controller value/action/selector required by this step is missing, stop and return the interface gap to `moda_architect` rather than widening this task.
- Preserve these existing pure/domain test assets byte-for-byte throughout ADMIN-001..008:
  - `tests/unit/merchant-pricing-builder-payload.test.ts` — SHA-256 `a985f89cbc9f4d41901d2c1e400935faf8453a5bd866ac0834a58b0851feb243`

### R1 — workbook remains mounted

Move the workbook wrapper and final step presentation into `translations-review-step.tsx`, but render that child for the wizard lifetime so the `MerchantPricingTranslationWorkbook` subtree stays mounted and is hidden outside step 6 exactly as today. Do not replace it with `{step === 6 ? <Workbook/> : null}` or otherwise discard selected-file/workbook issue/uploaded-bytes state during navigation.

Preserve the current conditional DOM for the rest of the final step: final review, admin-reason textarea and `MerchantPricingPlanSubmitButton` are rendered only while `step === 6`; keeping the child mounted must not make those controls present on earlier steps.

### R2 — final review fidelity

Preserve the current review summary, including human-readable fixed usage-event formatting (`formatBuilderEventPrice(...) ... per event ... Unlimited`), catalogue placement label, recurring/allowance counts, description/highlights, economics PASS/OVERRIDE/NOT PASS state and override failure codes/reason. Preserve the exact translation-state display precedence: when `translationsRetained` is true it displays `20/20 retained` even if a currently uploaded workbook result is also valid; otherwise a valid workbook displays `20/20 validated`; otherwise `Not validated`.

### R3 — form shell ownership

The top-level `merchant-pricing-plan-builder.tsx` remains owner of `<form action={mutateMerchantPricingPlanAction}>`, hidden fields, seven-step nav, Back/Next buttons and controller wiring. The child owns final-step admin reason/submit presentation but receives `canSubmit` and dispatches reason edits rather than rebuilding submission policy.

### R4 — definition of done

After extraction the public builder should read as a thin wizard shell/controller composition. It must not contain substantial step-specific JSX or independently duplicate state derivation from child modules.

## Work Items

- [ ] Extract the always-mounted translations/review child without changing mount lifetime.
- [ ] Move final review/admin reason/submit presentation.
- [ ] Reduce the top-level builder to form, hidden fields, nav, controller wiring and step composition.
- [ ] Run all accepted controller/security/policy tests plus full Admin suites/build/lint.

## Interfaces / Contracts

Repository-internal UI extraction only. Public contract remains `MerchantPricingPlanBuilder` at its existing module path and the existing `mutateMerchantPricingPlanAction` form submission contract. Canonical domain/policy modules are consumed rather than redefined.

## Dependencies

- `ARCH-025-ADMIN-007`

## Enables

None

## Stop Condition

After the defined Work Items, Acceptance Criteria and required Validation are complete, set the task to `review`, finish the Completion Report, return control to `moda_architect` and **STOP**. Do not begin the enabled or adjacent ARCH-025 Admin task.
