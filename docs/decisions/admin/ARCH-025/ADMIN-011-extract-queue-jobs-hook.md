# Extract QueueMonitor jobs browsing hook

## Architecture

Architecture ID: `ARCH-025`

Architecture document: `docs/architecture/ARCH-025-shopify-billing-service-maintainability.md`

Coordinator: `moda_architect`

## Objective

Extract queue-job result/filter/page/recent-vs-full/loading/error/AbortController lifecycle into a dedicated hook while preserving the current asymmetric state transitions exactly.

## Context

The jobs browser currently combines request dependencies with queue switch, filter, direction, page, manual refresh and View all transitions. Those transitions intentionally do not all clear selection or set loading in the same way, so the hook must make the asymmetries explicit rather than normalising them.

## Scope

Authorised implementation surface:

```text
src/components/admin/queue-monitor.tsx
src/components/admin/queue-monitor/use-queue-jobs.ts
tests/unit/queue-monitor-jobs-state.test.ts
```

## Out of Scope

Selected-job detail hook, drawer/view extraction, ADMIN-009 client/type changes, accepted ADMIN-010 summary hook changes, server/API changes.

## Requirements

### Common ARCH-025 QueueMonitor invariants

- This is a **move-only structural refactor**. Do not change QueueMonitor product behaviour, server authorization, Redis/BullMQ reads, HTTP response shapes, queue-job normalization/redaction, i18n/catalogue semantics or diagnostic exposure.
- Preserve `QueueMonitor` at `src/components/admin/queue-monitor.tsx` with the same exported name/caller boundary. Existing protected-page callers do not migrate.
- QueueMonitor remains strictly read-only. Do not add retry, requeue, delete, pause, resume or other mutation controls.
- Preserve the existing protected endpoints exactly: `/api/admin/queues`, `/api/admin/queues/jobs`, `/api/admin/queues/jobs/detail`. Do not change their routes, authorization ordering or response semantics.
- Preserve `src/lib/admin/queue-monitor.ts` as the canonical server reader/type owner. Browser modules must not import it at runtime; the client uses a bounded local mirror of the HTTP response shapes.
- Preserve `src/components/admin/queue-monitor-refresh.ts` as the canonical refresh-option/default/storage helper. Do not duplicate or change `REFRESH_OPTIONS`, `DEFAULT_REFRESH_MS`, `STORAGE_KEY`, `isRefreshValue()` or `getInitialRefreshMs()`.
- Preserve summary semantics: initial refresh is scheduled immediately after mount; at most one summary request is in flight; manual/poll attempts while one is running return without starting another; `cache: "no-store"`; aborts do not surface as data errors; failures retain the last successful snapshot; successful summary refresh clears the summary error and, when a queue is open, requests a jobs refresh.
- Preserve jobs semantics: stale requests abort on dependency changes; query keys remain `queue`, `status`, `shop`, `page`, `limit`, `direction`; recent mode uses limit `5`, full mode `10`; successful row replacement clears selected-job/detail state; non-abort failure sets jobs unavailable and clears the jobs snapshot.
- Preserve current state-transition asymmetries exactly: queue switch resets jobs/recent/page/error/selection/detail while retaining shop/status/direction filters and an already-open drawer width; Shop/Status changes explicitly prepare loading, reset page and clear selection/detail; Direction changes explicitly prepare loading/reset page but do not immediately clear selected detail; page changes and View all do not use the same explicit prepare-loading transition as filters.
- Preserve detail semantics: stale selections abort; detail query keys remain `queue`, `status`, `jobId`; HTTP 404 maps to `queue.jobGone`; other non-OK responses map to `queue.jobDetailsUnavailable`; aborts do not surface a user error.
- Preserve drawer semantics: first open starts maximized, switching queues while open preserves the current drawer width, close clears only selected queue/width/resizing (not stored jobs/detail), maximize sets width back to `null`, and pointer/keyboard resizing retains current bounds and ArrowLeft/ArrowRight/Home/End meanings.
- Preserve catalogue/i18n ownership: queue job names continue through `adminQueueJobLabel`, statuses through `adminStatusLabel`, dates/times through `adminI18n`, and no raw locale/currency formatting is introduced.
- Preserve bounded diagnostic presentation: selected detail may show the current normalized lifecycle fields, failed reason, stacktrace and normalized payload with copy controls; do not expose Redis/configuration credentials or additional raw provider/queue internals.
- Do not add a Redux/global state store, generic client data framework, generic HTTP framework or new React/browser test framework solely for this extraction.
- Keep tests honest: no skipped tests, weakened assertions or changed expected behaviour merely because code moved. `npm run test:unit`, `npm test` and production build must introduce no task regression.
- These server/API sources are frozen byte-for-byte throughout ADMIN-009..015: `src/lib/admin/queue-monitor.ts` (`f2270a0c76992059793ce1a3184b4e424675d8ea0dc2a3bbef03a0fadd202486`), `/api/admin/queues/route.ts` (`f0eaed7214b6d57341f37a04afcc6636efa325358c0ea62321b09c086c6df408`), `/api/admin/queues/jobs/route.ts` (`fd6413d4afd37a4c46208d397f9bc5903a0766a651866ba414acedb1b95368a7`), `/api/admin/queues/jobs/detail/route.ts` (`c367a8e6ac3674f54df815ee05ecfe682f65e7e5f8eb0f2feeff80a05b298bab`).
- These dedicated server/API tests are frozen byte-for-byte throughout ADMIN-009..015: `admin-queue-jobs.test.mjs` (`3bfc3954b2938ea6f7028f2db51cae26e943ea5d8845e1d7cab2eb87b96bd6bc`), `admin-queue-job-detail.test.mjs` (`e567406ccace44955ef9ff43c3e5b138e19f4be92677f13fd1e47d47ec3011e0`), `admin-failed-job-detail.test.mjs` (`da8dccc08b3981c45f39ca39cd0d6a0a98121e4f8b283c0cccb32db39a20e195`), `admin-failed-jobs.test.mjs` (`fad750721202bd646b13c1aba6c37464e0698618e6707775265f8fdb0f281609`).

### R1 — jobs state ownership

The hook owns `queueJobs`, `showAllJobs`, page, shop filter, status filter, direction, jobs loading/error, refresh generation and jobs request AbortController. The shell continues to own `selectedQueueName` and supplies it as input.

### R2 — explicit transition operations

Expose bounded operations for queue selection preparation, manual refresh, Shop change, Status change, Direction change, View all and previous/next page. Preserve current behavior exactly: queue switch resets jobs/showAll/page/error and begins loading but retains filters; Shop/Status change begins loading, resets page and requests selection/detail clearing; Direction begins loading/resets page without immediate selection clearing; View all sets full mode/page 1 and requests selection/detail clearing but does not use the explicit prepare-loading transition; page moves do not use that explicit transition.

### R3 — request lifecycle

Use the accepted ADMIN-009 client with one AbortController per current dependency set. Abort stale work before replacement. Successful result replaces rows and requests selection/detail clearing. Non-abort failure sets `queue.jobsUnavailable` and clears rows. Loading is cleared only by the currently-owned controller.

### R4 — cross-hook compatibility port

Because selected-job state remains outside this hook until ADMIN-012, accept one narrow callback/port used only at the exact transitions where the monolith currently clears selected job/detail. Do not import a future detail hook or recreate detail state locally.

## Work Items

- [ ] Move all jobs-browser state and request lifecycle to the hook.
- [ ] Preserve every transition asymmetry through explicit operations.
- [ ] Rewire shell/detail state through the narrow invalidation callback.
- [ ] Add pure state-transition tests for queue switch, filters, direction, View all and pagination.

## Interfaces / Contracts

ADMIN-011 consumes accepted ADMIN-009 client/types and ADMIN-010 summary callback integration. Its state/actions become the accepted jobs-control contract for ADMIN-012/015.

## Dependencies

- `ARCH-025-ADMIN-010`

## Enables

- `ARCH-025-ADMIN-012`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No jobs fetch/state implementation remains duplicated in the shell.
- [ ] Filters, query values, limits, abort/error/loading behavior and selection-clearing asymmetries match the baseline.
- [ ] Old rows remain eligible to stay visible during page/View all replacement exactly as today.
- [ ] Later tasks can clear/select detail through the bounded callback/interface without changing jobs state internals.
