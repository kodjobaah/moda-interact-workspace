# Build shop Agent Configuration override surface

## Architecture

Architecture ID:

ARCH-021

Architecture document:

`docs/architecture/ARCH-021-commerce-agent-configuration-live-studio-authoring.md`

Coordinator:

`moda_architect`

## Objective

Extend Agent Configuration so a platform admin can inspect effective configuration for the selected shop and independently manage that shop's model override and behavioural prompt override.

## Context

Phase 1 established server-validated `shopId` navigation context. Phase 2 now uses that context to configure one shop without making model/prompt feature-specific. Shop model and prompt fallback are independent, and removing an override returns only that dimension to platform inheritance.

## Scope

- Reuse the existing server-validated selected-shop Studio context.
- Show the selected shop's effective model and source (`PLATFORM` or `SHOP`).
- Allow SUPER_ADMIN to set/replace/clear the shop model override from enabled catalogue entries.
- Show the selected shop's effective prompt and source (`PLATFORM` or `SHOP`).
- Allow SUPER_ADMIN to create/edit/publish the shop prompt lineage and set/replace/clear its active override.
- Allow a shop prompt draft to be created from one exact published application-wide template revision.
- Clearly show inheritance when no override exists.
- Clearly show configuration error state when an explicit override is broken/disabled; do not present it as inherited.
- Preserve selected `shopId` across Agent Configuration navigation/refresh using the accepted Phase 1 mechanism.
- Extend the dedicated Agent Configuration domain component/module created by COMMERCE-011; do not add shop prompt/model editor state back into `StudioWorkspace`.
- ADMIN remains read-only.

## Out of Scope

- Merchant authentication/authorization.
- Merchant-owned prompt templates.
- Entitlement/tier policy for model overrides.
- Live chat/model execution.
- Grant/manifest/Background changes.
- Feature prompt removal.

## Requirements

- Model and prompt override actions are independent.
- `Clear model override` must not change prompt state.
- `Clear prompt override` must not change model state.
- Shop prompt operations must be scoped to the exact server-validated shop; a browser-supplied shop id must never bypass authorization/validation.
- A template creates a copied shop prompt draft; later template edits do not affect it.
- The UI must display effective ids/revisions/source so later preview work can prove what will be frozen.
- `StudioWorkspace` remains orchestration/navigation only for this surface; selected-shop authoring logic belongs to the Agent Configuration domain module.
- Broken explicit override state must remain visible and fail closed through the resolver.

## Work Items

- [ ] Extend the dedicated Agent Configuration domain module with the selected-shop sub-surface.
- [ ] Add selected-shop effective configuration summary.
- [ ] Add shop model override set/clear controls.
- [ ] Add shop prompt lineage/draft/publish/activate controls.
- [ ] Add create-from-template flow for shop prompt drafts.
- [ ] Add independent inheritance/reset controls and source labels.
- [ ] Preserve Phase 1 `shopId` navigation semantics.
- [ ] Add focused authorization/isolation/inheritance/error-state UI tests.

## Interfaces / Contracts

Consumes:

- selected-shop context from ARCH-021-COMMERCE-004;
- model configuration port from ARCH-021-COMMERCE-007 for shop model set/clear;
- prompt-template port from ARCH-021-COMMERCE-008 for selectable template discovery;
- prompt lifecycle port from ARCH-021-COMMERCE-009 for shop prompt draft/publish/active-pointer operations;
- effective configuration resolver from ARCH-021-COMMERCE-010;
- platform Agent Configuration domain surface from ARCH-021-COMMERCE-011 as the UI/module base.

Produces the complete Phase 2 internal-admin Agent Configuration experience.

## Dependencies

- ARCH-021-COMMERCE-004
- ARCH-021-COMMERCE-007
- ARCH-021-COMMERCE-008
- ARCH-021-COMMERCE-009
- ARCH-021-COMMERCE-010
- ARCH-021-COMMERCE-011

## Enables

None. Completion closes the Phase 2 implementation set; later phases are defined separately.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Selected shop shows effective model and prompt with independent PLATFORM/SHOP source labels.
- [ ] A shop may override only model, only prompt, both, or neither.
- [ ] Clearing one override preserves the other.
- [ ] Shop prompt authoring is isolated to the exact selected shop.
- [ ] Shop prompt may start from a published platform template as an independent copy.
- [ ] Broken explicit model/prompt overrides are displayed as configuration errors rather than silently inherited values.
- [ ] ADMIN is read-only and no secret/session token is rendered.
- [ ] Shop Agent Configuration logic does not re-accumulate inside `StudioWorkspace`.
- [ ] No live model/provider execution occurs.

## Validation

- [ ] focused shop Agent Configuration UI tests
- [ ] inheritance matrix UI tests
- [ ] cross-shop isolation/auth tests
- [ ] selected-shop navigation/refresh regressions
- [ ] targeted lint/typecheck
- [ ] `git diff --check`

## Stop Condition

After the defined Work Items, Acceptance Criteria and required Validation are complete, set the task to `review`, return the Completion Report to `moda_architect` and STOP. Do not begin Phase 3.

## Implementation Notes

Use the existing selected-shop context; do not introduce a second independent shop selector. The future merchant-facing Studio will replace platform-admin shop selection with merchant authorization but should reuse the same shop-scoped configuration service boundary.
