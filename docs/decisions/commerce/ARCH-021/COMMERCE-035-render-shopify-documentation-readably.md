# Normalize and render Shopify documentation readably

## Architecture

Architecture ID:

`ARCH-021`

Architecture document:

`docs/architecture/ARCH-021-commerce-agent-configuration-live-studio-authoring.md`

Coordinator:

`moda_architect`

## Objective

Replace raw Shopify documentation blobs with one safe, bounded, structured documentation contract so search results show readable plain-text excerpts and opened documents preserve meaningful headings, paragraphs, lists and code blocks without rendering raw HTML.

## Context

Manual validation of the Explore Documentation tab exposed two production defects.

Search uses pinned Shopify Dev MCP:

```text
learn_shopify_api
search_docs_chunks
```

and `lib/discovery/upstream.ts` currently maps the returned `content` directly to:

```text
UpstreamSearchItem.text
```

up to 2,000 characters.

`components/studio-workspace.tsx` then renders that value directly inside:

```tsx
<p>{item.text}</p>
```

Shopify search chunks can contain markdown links, code, JSON and HTML-like fragments. As a result the result list exposes syntax such as:

```text
[label](https://...)
{ "query": ... }
<...>
```

instead of a readable excerpt.

Opening a result is a separate path. `fetchShopifyDocument()` safely fetches the canonical `https://shopify.dev/docs/...` HTML and verifies a `main` or `article` container. However `lib/discovery/document.ts` reduces that container to one string with:

```text
readableText(...)
replace(/\s+/g, " ")
```

and the UI renders the complete value as one paragraph:

```tsx
<p>{document.text}</p>
```

This destroys headings, paragraph boundaries, lists, code/preformatted text and other useful reading structure.

The correction must preserve the existing security boundary: Shopify documentation is untrusted remote content. Do not use raw HTML injection.

## Scope

Primary files:

```text
lib/discovery/upstream.ts
lib/discovery/document.ts
lib/discovery/service.ts
src/studio/contracts.ts
src/commerce/integration/studio/services.ts
components/studio-workspace.tsx
app/globals.css
tests/discovery-document.test.ts
tests/discovery.test.ts
tests/studio-services.test.ts
tests/studio-workspace.test.tsx
tests/shopify-documentation-rendering.test.tsx   # new if useful
```

Additional directly affected documentation-only files may be changed when required by the normalized contract.

## Out of Scope

- Storefront schema browsing/query generation.
- COMMERCE-032/033/034 behavior.
- Live documentation editing.
- Rendering arbitrary remote HTML.
- A general-purpose browser/Markdown engine.
- Following arbitrary external links from remote content.
- Database/Shared/Background/Gateway changes.
- Shopify Admin API.
- Provider/model calls.

## Requirements

### R1 — separate search excerpts from full document content

The public Studio documentation contracts must distinguish:

```text
search result excerpt
full structured document
```

Search result DTO must contain at least:

```text
title
excerpt
sourceUrl
path
```

Do not call the search excerpt `text` if it can be confused with complete document content.

Full document DTO must contain at least:

```text
title
sourceUrl
blocks
relatedFieldPaths
```

Do not expose raw remote HTML to a Client Component.

### R2 — normalize search results to plain readable excerpts

Add one pure server-side normalization function for `search_docs_chunks.content`.

The resulting excerpt must:

1. decode common HTML entities;
2. remove HTML tags rather than displaying them;
3. convert Markdown links:
   ```text
   [label](url)
   ```
   to readable label text;
4. convert Markdown images:
   ```text
   ![alt](url)
   ```
   to alt text or omit them when alt is blank;
5. remove Markdown heading/list/fence markers;
6. preserve useful inline-code text but remove the backtick markup;
7. collapse whitespace;
8. omit zero-width/control characters other than ordinary spaces;
9. contain no executable/rendered HTML;
10. be bounded to at most 600 visible characters and at most 2 KiB UTF-8.

If normalization yields an empty excerpt, return a bounded fallback such as:

```text
No preview available.
```

Do not fetch every result page merely to build search excerpts.

### R3 — structured full-document contract

Normalize the verified Shopify `main`/`article` HTML into a bounded block model.

Support exactly these public block kinds for this checkpoint:

```text
HEADING
PARAGRAPH
LIST
CODE
BLOCKQUOTE
```

Required shape:

```text
HEADING:
  level: 2 | 3 | 4
  text: string

PARAGRAPH:
  text: string

LIST:
  ordered: boolean
  items: string[]

CODE:
  text: string

BLOCKQUOTE:
  text: string
```

Unknown/unsupported readable block containers may degrade to `PARAGRAPH`.

Do not expose tag names or raw HTML in the public block contract.

### R4 — preserve meaningful document structure

The HTML normalizer must preserve:

- heading boundaries;
- paragraph boundaries;
- ordered/unordered list-item boundaries;
- `<pre>` / code-block whitespace and newlines;
- blockquote boundaries.

Inline elements inside paragraphs/headings/list items may be flattened to readable text for this checkpoint.

For example:

```html
<h2>Create a customer</h2>
<p>Use <code>customerCreate</code>.</p>
<ul><li>Create</li><li>Activate</li></ul>
<pre>mutation Example { ... }</pre>
```

must normalize into four distinct blocks, not one concatenated string.

Do not globally run `replace(/\s+/g, " ")` across code/preformatted content.

### R5 — discard non-content/sensitive browser elements

Continue excluding at least:

```text
script
style
nav
footer
iframe
object
embed
form
noscript
template
```

Also exclude interactive/browser-only controls such as:

```text
button
input
select
textarea
svg
canvas
```

Their attributes/event handlers must never reach the public DTO.

### R6 — bounded output

Retain the current bounded-fetch/security behavior:

```text
max input:  1 MiB
max redirects: 2
canonical origin: https://shopify.dev/docs/
```

The structured serialized full-document output must remain bounded to:

```text
64 KiB UTF-8
```

Additionally enforce:

```text
maximum blocks:          256
maximum list items/block: 100
maximum normal text/block: 8 KiB UTF-8
maximum code block:      16 KiB UTF-8
```

Reject documents exceeding the bounds rather than silently truncating the opened document.

Search excerpts may be deliberately truncated because they are previews.

### R7 — readable UI

Replace the raw result/document rendering in `StudioWorkspace`.

Search results must render as readable result cards/list items containing:

```text
title
bounded excerpt
canonical source indication
Open/read action
```

Do not render a 2,000-character raw chunk as the result paragraph.

Opened documents must render inside a semantic:

```tsx
<article>
```

with block-specific elements:

```text
HEADING    -> h3/h4/h5 or equivalent bounded hierarchy
PARAGRAPH  -> p
LIST       -> ul/ol + li
CODE       -> pre > code
BLOCKQUOTE -> blockquote
```

Add bounded documentation-reader CSS:

- readable line length (`max-width` around 70–80ch);
- normal paragraph spacing;
- list indentation;
- distinct headings;
- horizontally scrollable code blocks;
- code preserves whitespace;
- long unbroken content wraps safely outside code blocks.

Do not use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

### R8 — canonical source link

Opened documentation may display an `Open on Shopify` link using the already canonicalized `sourceUrl`.

Requirements:

```text
target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"
```

Do not render links discovered inside remote HTML in this checkpoint.

### R9 — no raw markup regressions

Focused tests must prove search excerpts do not expose raw markup.

At minimum use search content containing all of:

```text
<h2>Heading</h2>
[Product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront/current/objects/Product)
`product`
```graphql
query X { shop { name } }
```
```

and prove the rendered search result:

- contains readable words;
- does not show `<h2>`;
- does not show `](https://`;
- does not show triple backticks.

### R10 — full-document structure regression

Use a verified HTML document containing:

```text
title
h2
two paragraphs
unordered list
ordered list
blockquote
pre/code with multiple lines
script/style noise
```

Prove the normalized block sequence and the React rendering preserve those distinct structures.

Also prove no script/style content appears.

### R11 — contract parity

Tests must exercise the same normalization functions and Studio contracts production uses.

Do not create a richer documentation fixture shape that production never returns.

The in-memory Studio fixture must be updated to use the exact final public documentation DTO.

### R12 — do not broaden upstream trust

Keep the current upstream split:

```text
search:
  pinned Shopify Dev MCP search_docs_chunks

open:
  verified direct fetch from canonical shopify.dev/docs URL
```

Do not render MCP-provided full HTML as trusted content.

Do not replace the verified direct-document fetch with arbitrary URLs returned by search.

## Work Items

- [ ] Add plain-text search-excerpt normalizer.
- [ ] Replace `DocumentationItem.text` with bounded `excerpt`.
- [ ] Add structured documentation block contract.
- [ ] Refactor verified HTML extraction to preserve block structure.
- [ ] Preserve code/pre whitespace.
- [ ] Enforce structured-document bounds.
- [ ] Update Studio service adapter/contracts.
- [ ] Render search results as bounded readable cards/items.
- [ ] Render opened document as semantic structured article.
- [ ] Add canonical `Open on Shopify` action.
- [ ] Add readable documentation CSS.
- [ ] Update in-memory fixtures to exact production DTO shape.
- [ ] Add raw-markup and structured-rendering regressions.

## Interfaces / Contracts

Changes only Commerce-local Studio documentation contracts.

Search:

```text
DocumentationItem:
  title
  excerpt
  sourceUrl
  path
```

Full document:

```text
DocumentationDocument:
  title
  sourceUrl
  blocks
  relatedFieldPaths
```

No cross-service contract is introduced.

## Dependencies

- ARCH-021-COMMERCE-034

## Enables

- ARCH-021-SYSTEM-TEST-001

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search results no longer display raw HTML/Markdown syntax.
- [ ] Search results show bounded readable excerpts.
- [ ] Opened documentation is not rendered as one giant paragraph.
- [ ] Headings, paragraphs, lists, code and blockquotes retain separate structure.
- [ ] Code/preformatted text retains meaningful newlines/whitespace.
- [ ] No raw HTML reaches `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- [ ] Non-content/script/style elements are absent from output.
- [ ] Canonical source URL remains constrained to `shopify.dev/docs`.
- [ ] Existing input/output/redirect bounds remain enforced.
- [ ] Tests and fixtures consume the same final documentation DTO as production.

## Validation

- [ ] `npx vitest run tests/discovery-document.test.ts tests/discovery.test.ts tests/studio-services.test.ts tests/studio-workspace.test.tsx tests/shopify-documentation-rendering.test.tsx --reporter=verbose` (omit the final file only if coverage is kept in the existing named tests)
- [ ] targeted ESLint for every changed source/test file
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` (unchanged unrelated baseline may be recorded; zero task-owned diagnostics required)
- [ ] source audit:
  ```text
  rg -n "dangerouslySetInnerHTML|<p>\{document\.text\}</p>|item\.text" \
    components src/studio lib/discovery
  ```
  expected: no documentation-rendering matches
- [ ] `git diff --check`

## Stop Condition

After the defined Work Items, Acceptance Criteria and required Validation are complete, set the task to `review`, complete the Completion Report, return to `moda_architect` and STOP.

Do not start SYSTEM-TEST-001.

## Implementation Notes

Do not solve readability by increasing container width alone. The data contract currently destroys/forwards the wrong structure and must be corrected first.

Do not add a heavyweight generic HTML/Markdown rendering system unless the bounded requirements above genuinely cannot be met with the existing verified parser. This task needs a small safe documentation renderer, not a CMS.

Do not render remote HTML with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

The full-document parser may flatten inline formatting for this checkpoint. Preserving block structure is the required outcome.
