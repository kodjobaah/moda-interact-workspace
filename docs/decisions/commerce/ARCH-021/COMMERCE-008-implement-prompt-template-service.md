# Implement category-organised prompt-template authoring service

## Architecture

Architecture ID:

ARCH-021

Architecture document:

`docs/architecture/ARCH-021-commerce-agent-configuration-live-studio-authoring.md`

Coordinator:

`moda_architect`

## Objective

Provide authenticated platform-admin lifecycle operations for data-driven prompt-template categories and reusable application-wide CommerceAgent prompt templates with immutable published revisions.

## Context

Templates are reusable authoring starting points. They are deliberately independent of model selection and they are never the active runtime prompt. Templates are organised by a platform-managed data-driven category/classification such as `Clothing & Fashion`; a category can contain multiple templates. A later prompt draft may be created from an exact published template revision by copying its text and recording provenance.

## Scope

- List/create/update/enable/disable platform prompt-template categories/classifications.
- List/search/filter/group enabled and historical prompt templates/revisions by category for internal Studio use.
- Require each template identity to belong to one category while allowing multiple templates under the same category.
- SUPER_ADMIN create template identities, create/update drafts, publish revisions and enable/disable templates.
- Enforce immutable published revision content.
- Produce stable content hashes/revision identity using the accepted repository conventions.
- Write durable audit events for privileged lifecycle changes.
- Expose typed server actions/port operations for later Studio UI and prompt creation.

## Out of Scope

- Shop-owned templates.
- Active platform/shop prompts.
- Model configuration.
- Model-specific automatic prompt switching.
- Provider calls or prompt execution.
- Runtime prompt rendering.

## Requirements

- Templates remain application-wide in Phase 2.
- ADMIN is read-only; mutations require SUPER_ADMIN outside development bypass.
- Categories are data-driven records, not an enum or hard-coded application list.
- Category slug/identity is stable; display metadata may be edited and audited.
- Disabling a category prevents normal new-authoring assignment/selection while preserving existing template/history visibility.
- A category may contain multiple templates; each template has exactly one category.
- `developmentBypass === true` uses the accepted canonical development actor semantics.
- Published revisions cannot be edited; a new revision is required.
- Historical/provenance exact-id reads may resolve disabled categories/templates and their published revisions so existing provenance remains inspectable.
- New-authoring selectable lookup requires both the category and template to be enabled and the requested revision to be published; callers must not bypass disablement merely by supplying an exact revision id.
- No operation may mutate prompts that were previously created from a template.

## Work Items

- [ ] Implement category/classification list/create/update/enable/disable service.
- [ ] Implement template list/detail/filter/group service by category.
- [ ] Implement draft create/update with CAS/idempotent mutation behaviour.
- [ ] Implement immutable publish operation.
- [ ] Implement enable/disable operation.
- [ ] Add durable audit writes.
- [ ] Expose typed server actions/Studio port.
- [ ] Add focused lifecycle/auth/replay tests.

## Interfaces / Contracts

Consumes:

- ARCH-021-DATABASE-001 prompt-template category/template/revision persistence.
- existing Studio authentication.

Produces:

- category/classification identities and category-grouped template discovery;
- exact published template revision identity/content plus new-authoring selectability semantics for COMMERCE-009 copy-on-use prompt creation;
- template authoring port for COMMERCE-011 platform UI.

## Dependencies

- ARCH-021-DATABASE-001
- ARCH-020-COMMERCE-002

## Enables

- ARCH-021-COMMERCE-009
- ARCH-021-COMMERCE-011

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Platform admins can create/manage data-driven template categories and place multiple templates in one category.
- [ ] Platform admins can create and version reusable prompt templates.
- [ ] Published template revisions are immutable.
- [ ] Disabling a category or template prevents normal new selection/assignment, including direct exact-id selection, while preserving historical/provenance reads.
- [ ] Template edits never propagate into an existing prompt.
- [ ] Authorization, CAS/replay and audit semantics are tested.
- [ ] No runtime model/provider execution occurs.

## Validation

- [ ] focused prompt-template category + lifecycle tests
- [ ] focused auth/development-bypass tests
- [ ] targeted lint/typecheck
- [ ] `git diff --check`

## Stop Condition

After the defined Work Items, Acceptance Criteria and required Validation are complete, set the task to `review`, return the Completion Report to `moda_architect` and STOP.

## Implementation Notes

The service may expose a helper that returns exact published template revision text for copying, but it must not expose a mechanism that leaves prompt content dynamically linked to the template.
