# ARCH-020 commerce tasks

Architecture: [ARCH-020-commerce-agent-studio-mcp-capabilities.md](../../../architecture/ARCH-020-commerce-agent-studio-mcp-capabilities.md).

Assigned agent: moda_commerce. Repository: moda-interact-commerce. Coordinator: moda_architect.

COMMERCE-001 is architect-accepted Complete at Attempt 3 (`d7c1c65`). The descendant-process cleanup correction passed focused functional validation; prior real Docker PostgreSQL/Redis readiness evidence is retained. COMMERCE-002 is architect-accepted Complete at Attempt 2 (`fb3362e`): development HTTP mutations and revoked-session recovery are corrected. Live Google OAuth remains developer-owned deployment validation. Downstream source consumption awaits developer integration or explicit accepted-commit approval; no task is promoted or launched. COMMERCE-001 remains accepted and integrated. Other task rows retain this branch snapshot; canonical task worktrees remain authoritative.

2026-09-21: COMMERCE-003/008 promoted Ready for C17 interface-based parallel work.
Component acceptance uses C17 fixtures;013 separately owns real integration. This
supersedes earlier no-promotion wording for these two tasks only.011 active task
worktree status remains authoritative. No task was claimed by this amendment.


## COMMERCE-003 Attempt 1 review — 2026-09-21

Current decision: Ready for Changes Requested, Attempt 1, claim cleared; not
accepted. Reviewed 211b4a3 / 19441950. R1 Shared schemas/canonical hashes;
R2 immutable ownership/unique release members; R3 complete C17 ports and lifecycle
component with transactional fixtures; R4 pagination skipping rows. Eight original
fixture tests passed and four architect regressions failed. Exact correction
instructions/tests are in the task. C17 fixture acceptance remains permitted;
013 production composition and developer PostgreSQL rehearsal remain separate.
No new claim, downstream promotion, main integration or gitlink update.


## COMMERCE-003 Attempt 2 review — 2026-09-21

Current decision: Ready, Attempt 2, claim cleared; Changes Requested, not accepted.
Reviewed d5d7f56 / 6f4359a3. The17 submitted focused tests pass independently;
three added architect regressions fail (ADMIN draft status injection, scalar
configuration publication, incompatible release activation). Exact A2-R1–R4
corrections cover strict command/persistence validation, runtime compatibility,
canonical Feature/selection ports and executable transaction rehearsal evidence.
Preserve the working Shared hashes, ownership/membership and cursor fixes.
See the task for file-level algorithms/tests. This supersedes previous current-state
wording. C17 component acceptance remains permitted;013 composition and developer
PostgreSQL execution remain separate. No promotion, claim, main merge or gitlink edit.


## COMMERCE-003 Attempt 3 review — 2026-09-21

Current decision: Ready, Attempt3 retained, claim cleared; Changes Requested for
the remaining rehearsal deliverable. Reviewed ebe612bb /3d58f69f. Strict inputs,
compatibility and Feature/storage corrections are present;26 focused tests,
shell syntax and diff checks independently pass. A3-R1 documents immutable-row
cleanup failure, arbitrary SQL-error masking, replay assertion and worker-teardown
corrections. Preserve passing component code. PostgreSQL execution remains
explicitly developer-owned/unrun;013 composition remains separate. This is the
latest decision. No downstream promotion, new claim, main merge or gitlink edit.

## COMMERCE-003 Attempt 4 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-003 is **Complete, architect accepted, Attempt 4 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `12df0104` and report `4b86771f`. The isolated rehearsal
now fails closed on unexpected SQL/cleanup errors, identifies its injected
rollback case, checks audit-backed replay and reaps owned workers. Independently
passed 26 lifecycle tests, shell syntax, four mock harness scenarios and diff
checks. Live disposable PostgreSQL execution remains explicitly developer-owned
and unrun; COMMERCE-013 owns real adapter/integration composition. No main merge
or gitlink update. COMMERCE-004 is promoted Ready (003 and SHARED-001 Complete),
without claiming an attempt. Other dependent tasks retain their current states;
012/013/system-test still have unresolved prerequisites. This acceptance supersedes
older COMMERCE-003 current-state wording; architecture is not yet Implemented.
2026-09-21 C19 split:004 transport/014 executor,005 queries/015 basket-products,
006 rule reader/016 evaluator,009 backend/017 U14 frontend.013 owns real pairing.
006/009/015 are newly Ready from accepted prerequisites; no task was launched.

## COMMERCE-011 Attempt 9 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-011 is **Complete, architect accepted, Attempt 9 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `1176412` and report `ccb35ea3`; clean dedicated worktrees
and matching remote heads verified. R8-1 inline text order is fixed; all four prior
review reproductions and 38 focused checks passed independently. Submitted full
suite remains 117/119 with two existing readiness timing failures in unchanged
code; no green full-suite or live Redis claim is made. Live Redis/OAuth/Shopify/
deployment checks remain developer-owned and pending. COMMERCE-005 is promoted
Ready (001/011/Shared Complete), with no new claim. Other dependants retain current
states because prerequisites remain unresolved. No main merge or gitlink update;
architecture is not Implemented. This supersedes older COMMERCE-011 current-state
wording while preserving historical reviews.

## COMMERCE-015 Attempt 2 review — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-015 is **Ready, Attempt 2 retained**, claim cleared, not accepted.
Reviewed implementation `8793bc2` and report `b791e1c`; clean isolated worktrees
and matching remote heads verified. Working registry/auth/null-line improvements
are retained. Remaining corrections: terminal-page continuation, nullable facts
nodes, historical snapshot currency provenance, and async recovery/nested-provider
failure handling. Independent checks: 9 submitted tests passed, 5 functional
reproductions failed. See the latest task Architect Review for exact instructions.
Reported unrelated baseline failures and pending live validation are not the
review blockers. No dependent promotion, main merge or gitlink change. This note
supersedes earlier COMMERCE-015 current-state wording.

## COMMERCE-015 Attempt 3 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-015 is **Complete, architect accepted, Attempt 3 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `511e14ad` and report `a8c9a9e3`; clean dedicated worktrees
and matching remote heads verified. All five previous functional failures are
resolved: terminal-page continuation, nullable nodes, snapshot currency provenance,
post-authorization cancellation and nested provider error propagation. Independent
checks passed: 14 previous harness cases (including all five reproductions), plus
13 current focused tests and diff check. Submitted full-suite Redis timeout remains
separate; live Shopify/integration validation is still developer-owned and pending.
No dependent promotion:016 still needs006,007 needs016, and012/013/system-test have
other prerequisites. No main merge/gitlink change; architecture is not Implemented.
This acceptance supersedes all older COMMERCE-015 current-state wording.

## COMMERCE-006 Attempt 3 architect review — 2026-09-21

Changes Requested; Ready, Attempt3 retained, claim clear; not accepted.
Verified de532c6/ec088f27. A2 NONE, fraction conversion and zero-value fixes pass;
both documents now pass pinned Admin2026-07 schema validation. Nineteen submitted
reader tests pass; four added cases fail. A3-R1 corrects nested first:1000 runtime
limits with an explicit bounded partial-target profile. A3-R2 requires typed
cancellation, pre-dispatch checks and rejection of late successful data.
See the canonical COMMERCE-006 task for precise code locations and expected effects.
No live validation gate, dependent promotion, new claim, implementation change,
main integration or gitlink update. Parent overlay published before preparation.


## COMMERCE-006 Attempt 4 accepted — 2026-09-21

Current decision: Complete, architect accepted; Attempt4 retained, claim clear.
Implementation1c124f4 / report70c3cf24. A3-R1 bounded nested5-item query profile
and A3-R2 typed cancellation/late-result guards accepted. Independent reader/auth
27/27 pass; prior architect harness23/23 pass, including all4 prior failures.
Live Shopify/provider assembly and unproven semantics remain explicitly separate;
unknown facts must stay unknown.006 prerequisite is satisfied, but016 still awaits
015;012/013/system-test retain other unfinished dependencies. No downstream
promotion, implementation changes, main integration or gitlink update. See the
canonical task's latest Accepted review for validation limits and integration order.


## COMMERCE-004 Attempt 2 architect review — 2026-09-21

Changes Requested; Ready, Attempt2 retained, claim clear; not accepted.
Reviewed5ef60bd/5d54102b. Submitted12 tests pass; four added tests fail:
last-write association bounds, missing pinned definition, malformed JSON503,
and ignored-abort executor holding the response past deadline. A2-R1–R3 define
original-association/tool-revocation resolution, protocol/aggregate bounds and
bounded execution waiting. Retain actual prompt and true-handler interoperability
improvements. See canonical task for precise files and acceptance effects.
No promotion, new claim, main integration or gitlink update; live validation
remains separate from component corrections.

## COMMERCE-004 Attempt 3 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-004 is **Accepted / Complete, Attempt 3 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `0411babc` and parent report `b272d1a9` against remote heads.
Original-association minima, required pinned records/current revocation, SDK
transport/protocol bounds and bounded executor waiting resolve A2-R1–A2-R3.
Independent validation passed18 focused MCP tests and all four prior failure
reproductions; diff checks passed. Submitted typecheck/lint/build passed; reported
full-suite infrastructure failures remain separate from component acceptance.
Live Background assertions, Redis, production adapter/provider and deployment
validation remain developer/integration-owned. COMMERCE-014 is promoted Ready,
Attempt0 with no claim, because004/SHARED-001 are Complete. Other dependants retain
their unresolved gates;012 is still the final implementation checkpoint.
No implementation changes, main integration or gitlink update. Architecture is not
yet Implemented. This supersedes older004 state wording and retains review history.
## COMMERCE-009 Attempt 4 accepted — 2026-09-21

Complete, architect accepted; Attempt4 retained, claim clear. Reviewed5d4dcd3 /
ef556b4c. Expired-owner execution fence verified in memory/Redis and all dispatch
boundaries. Independent37/37 focused tests pass, including actual isolated Lua;
prior architect expiry/replacement reproduction1/1 passes with0 stale model calls.
Prior accepted prompt/history/language/replay/bounded-state corrections retained.
009 is satisfied;012/013/system-test retain other unfinished prerequisites, and
017 has no009 dependency. No promotion or automatic execution. Live deployment
and013 assembly remain separate. No main integration or gitlink update.
## COMMERCE-008 Attempt 5 review — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-008 is **Ready, Attempt 5 retained**, claim cleared, not accepted.
Reviewed implementation `558432f` and report `0b2e03bb`; remote heads matched and
worktrees were clean. A4-R2/R3 are accepted; all three previous reproductions and
25 focused tests passed independently. One remaining A5-R1 failure: adding a
nested field beneath an existing aliased product creates an unbound second root
outside the retained resultPath. The canonical task review contains exact AST
merge/validation instructions. Local U14 handoff passes; real preview integration
and live validation remain separately owned and are not blockers. No dependent
promotion or main integration. This supersedes older COMMERCE-008 state wording.

## COMMERCE-008 Attempt 6 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-008 is **Accepted / Complete, Attempt 6 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `8ba5e42` and report `7f8e194` against remote task heads.
The final alias correction preserves the existing field's arguments/result path,
rejects ambiguous edits and denies unbound duplicate roots. Independent validation:
24 focused tests and all four previous architect reproductions passed; diff checks
passed. Submitted typecheck/lint/build passed; the reported208-pass/one unrelated
Redis timeout does not block this component acceptance. Live OAuth/providers,
production composition and actual U14 execution remain separate integration work.
COMMERCE-017 is promoted Ready, Attempt0, no claim, because008/002/SHARED-001 are
accepted Complete.009 is not a prerequisite for017's contract-fixture frontend.
Other downstream tasks remain gated by their own unresolved prerequisites;012 is
still the final implementation checkpoint. No implementation changes, main merge,
main push or gitlink update. Architecture is not yet Implemented. This supersedes
older008 state wording while retaining historical reviews.

## COMMERCE-014 Attempt 1 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-014 is **Accepted / Complete, Attempt 1 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `232cbdd` and report `6dc01a40` against remote task heads.
Exact-version definition dispatch, Shared mappings/output validation, trusted-context
separation and bounded one-pass rendering satisfy the owned component contract.
Independent11 focused tests and diff checks passed. Lint/typecheck/build and wider
suite results remain submitted evidence.013 owns real adapter registration and
integrated policy/query execution; live infrastructure/evidence validation remains
separate. No dependent promotion, new claim, implementation edit, main integration
or gitlink update.012 remains the final implementation checkpoint; architecture is
not yet Implemented. Older014 readiness wording is historical.
## COMMERCE-016 Attempt 1 architect review — 2026-09-21

Changes Requested; Ready, Attempt 1 retained, claim cleared; not accepted.
Reviewed implementation `bfbd7839` and report `f96b41df` against remote task heads.
Independent submitted contract suites passed50/50; three isolated functional
reproductions fail: unknown current basket variant facts still qualify, a LINE
rounding cap understates100% savings, and mixed-currency proposal amounts produce
a false known subtotal failure. R1–R3 give explicit evaluator corrections and
expected outputs in the task report. Pure arithmetic/Shared evidence and shared
budget boundaries are retained. No implementation edits, next claim, main merge,
gitlink update or dependent promotion.007 remains gated by016;013 and012 retain
their remaining gates. Live provider composition remains separate integration work.
Older readiness wording is historical; architecture is not yet Implemented.


## COMMERCE-016 Attempt 2 accepted — 2026-09-21

Complete, architect accepted; Attempt2 retained, claim clear. Reviewed55204ec /
dc9edf85. Current-fact checks, consistent LINE/TOTAL savings caps and comparable
currency minimum precedence accepted. Independent evaluator15/15 and previous
architect regressions3/3 pass.007 promoted to Ready because015/016 are Complete;
attempt0/claim unchanged, no execution.012/013/system-test retain other unmet
prerequisites. Live integration and reader baseline limitation remain separate.
No implementation changes, main integration or gitlink update.

## COMMERCE-005 Attempt 2 architect review — 2026-09-21

Changes Requested; Ready, Attempt2 retained, claim clear; not accepted.
Reviewed2761e6b/e4fc15cd. Seven submitted tests pass; two task-owned review cases
fail: populated list selection validation and blocked stream cancellation.
A2-R1–R3 give exact recursion fix, active body cleanup and C14 UNAVAILABLE mapping
for provider-version fallback. Retain variable validation/HTTP envelope/deadline
race improvements. No scope expansion, promotion, new claim, main merge or gitlink
change. See task for exact acceptance effects; live provider validation is separate.


## COMMERCE-005 Attempt 3 architect review — 2026-09-21

Changes Requested; Ready, Attempt3 retained, claim clear; not accepted.
Reviewed6b2c410/4b681aa1. List recursion and provider-version/redirect fixes verified.
Eleven submitted tests pass; two cleanup cases fail: awaited rejected-body cancel
exceeds deadline and pending AsyncIterable read is not interrupted. A3-R1 gives
bounded cleanup and a minimal ReadableStream/Uint8Array-only contract correction.
No new scope, downstream promotion, claim, main merge or gitlink update. See task
for exact effects; live provider and baseline validation remain separate.

## COMMERCE-005 Attempt 4 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-005 is **Accepted / Complete, Attempt 4 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `f099659` and report `e5662be5` against remote heads.
A3-R1 is resolved: rejected/late body cleanup no longer delays typed responses;
cleanup rejections are observed; only Uint8Array/ReadableStream bodies are supported,
and unsupported iterators are rejected without consumption. Existing stream and
query corrections remain. Independent13 focused tests and the prior pending-cleanup
reproduction passed; diff checks passed. Typecheck/lint/build and full272/275 are
submitted evidence; baseline failures do not block this component acceptance.
013 owns real transport composition; live Shopify/provider validation remains
pending. No dependent promotion, new claim, main integration or gitlink update.
012 remains the final implementation checkpoint; architecture is not yet Implemented.
This supersedes older005 current-state wording while preserving review history.

## COMMERCE-017 Attempt 3 architect review — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-017 is **Changes Requested / Ready, Attempt 3 retained**, executor and
claimed_at cleared; not accepted. Reviewed implementation `64847e64` and parent
report `f3644a64` against their remote task heads. Independent UI/client tests
passed 12/12 and all four previous reproductions now pass. Four new reproductions
fail: second-run cancellation remains locked, empty catalogue permits a tool POST,
malformed HTTP failures discard uncertainty, and nullable input types bypass
validation. Direct-entry saved-source selection also remains unimplemented.
The task's A3-R1–R4 specify exact files, corrections and expected request effects;
preserve the verified prior fixes. Authenticated browser evidence remains pending
local Studio identity; source-selection implementation is still task-owned.
No new claim, dependent promotion, implementation change, main integration or
gitlink update. This overlay supersedes older COMMERCE-017 current-state wording only;
other task decisions and historical reports remain unchanged. Architecture is
not yet Implemented; COMMERCE-012 remains the final implementation checkpoint.
