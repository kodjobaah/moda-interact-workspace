# ARCH-040-SYSTEM-TEST-003 — Certify Woo customer inbox end-to-end

## Architecture

Initiative: `ARCH-040`. Architecture document: `docs/architecture/ARCH-040-merchant-customer-conversations-human-handover.md`. Coordinator: `moda_architect`. **Portable definition only; defined but not materialised, no branch/commit/worktree.**

## Objective

Validate Woo WordPress-to-hosted-API conversation controls and shared billing without duplicating thread state.

## Context

The approved direction is one existing `Conversation` for one `CheckoutRecovery` generation, with author-distinguished messages and one recovery-wide post-24-hour follow-up shared between human and AI. This task changes only the assigned repository boundary.

## Scope

- Implement the bounded system-test capability described by the objective.
- Add focused tests and evidence for that capability.

## Out of Scope

- No creation of a second Conversation for human chat or a recovery follow-up.
- No independent human-only follow-up allowance or duplicate usage counter.
- No updates to docs/decisions/**/_index.md pending explicit user confirmation.
- No opportunistic cross-repository work or additional task execution.

## Requirements

- Test manage_woocommerce and nonce permissions, credential rotation, tenant isolation and twenty UI locales.
- Validate plugin ZIP clean install/upgrade, real WordPress REST proxy, approved template and follow-up credit race.

## Work Items

- [ ] Test manage_woocommerce and nonce permissions, credential rotation, tenant isolation and twenty UI locales.
- [ ] Validate plugin ZIP clean install/upgrade, real WordPress REST proxy, approved template and follow-up credit race.

## Interfaces / Contracts

Use the single versioned cross-repository runtime contract owned by `ARCH-040-SHARED-001` and published by `ARCH-040-SHARED-002`; where a task operates before that gate, define schema-compatible fields in its own boundary and do not import unpublished sibling source. Canonical persisted entities: `Conversation`, `ConversationMessage`, `RecoveryOutreachAttempt` and the approved durable command/outbox. The provider request stays in Background; Woo browser traffic stays on WordPress REST.

## Dependencies

- ARCH-040-WOOCOMMERCE-003
- ARCH-040-SYSTEM-TEST-001

## Enables

None.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Woo messages persist in same canonical Conversation.
- [ ] Takeover, handoff, service window and credit policy match Shopify.

## Validation

- [ ] Black-box Woo LocalWP/integration suite
- [ ] Evidence bundle and plugin ZIP checks
- [ ] git diff --check; review canonical task-worktree and dependency-sync evidence

## Stop Condition

After only this task’s Work Items, Acceptance Criteria and Validation are complete, record implementation evidence, set status to review and return control to moda_architect. Do not begin dependent tasks. Publication tasks validate only publication mechanics.

## Implementation Notes

Use `scripts/start-agent-task.py --prepare` in the actual developer workspace when this definition is materialised; keep matching parent and implementation task branches in separate launcher-resolved worktrees, as documented in workspace policy. Check actual repository scripts before validation. Structured logging must use the published shared logger; no credentials or full customer content in logs. Preserve current production compatibility unless architect specifically establishes a safe pre-production breaking rollout.
