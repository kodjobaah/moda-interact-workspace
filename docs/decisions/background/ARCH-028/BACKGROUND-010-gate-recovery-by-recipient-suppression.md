# Gate recovery admission by Shop-scoped recipient suppression

## Architecture

Architecture ID: `ARCH-028`

Architecture document: `docs/architecture/ARCH-028-whatsapp-delivery-failure-convergence.md`

Coordinator: `moda_architect`

## Objective

Read the existing Shop-scoped recipient reachability evidence before initial or follow-up recovery admission, preventing provider and billing work during active suppression and safely resuming only after its expiry.

## Context

BACKGROUND-005 supplies the exact canonical recipient/attempt snapshot. DATABASE-001 supplies the indexed reachability record, policy duration and `WHATSAPP_RECIPIENT_SUPPRESSED` block reason. Suppression reads are independent of recording terminal failures, which is owned by BACKGROUND-011.

## Scope

- Check `(shopId, canonicalRecipient)` reachability against current time before creating a billable attempt or calling Meta for initial/follow-up outreach.
- For active `suppressUntil`, perform zero recovery admission/billing and zero provider sends; where an already-materialised recovery is eligible for blocking, use `WHATSAPP_RECIPIENT_SUPPRESSED` and existing recovery lifecycle rules.
- On expiry or valid new recipient, re-evaluate eligibility with fresh Shop/customer/checkout state; reuse existing bounded resume scheduling rather than new infrastructure.
- A changed current phone maps to a distinct recipient key and is eligible independently; maintain idempotency under duplicate candidates and multiple workers.

## Out of Scope

- Provider-failure evidence writes, suppression upserts or clearing (BACKGROUND-011).
- Monetary/capacity compensation (BACKGROUND-004/009).
- Missing phone pre-materialisation (BACKGROUND-007).
- Creating a global phone blacklist or a second scheduler.

## Requirements

- [ ] One indexed `(shopId, recipient)` lookup determines suppression; a row for another Shop never blocks the current Shop.
- [ ] Suppression is checked before recovery billing/outbound admission in both initial and follow-up paths.
- [ ] Expiry alone stops blocking; no indefinite suppression or busy polling.
- [ ] Re-evaluation preserves checkout/recovery validity and no duplicate sends or charges.
- [ ] New production source files target <=200 lines and never exceed 300; keep large existing modules integration-only.

## Work Items

- [ ] Add a focused suppression admission policy/reader using DATABASE-001 fields and BACKGROUND-005 snapshot.
- [ ] Wire initial and follow-up gating before billing/provider work.
- [ ] Reuse bounded recovery-resume scheduling for eligible blocked DETECTED cases.
- [ ] Add expiry, changed-recipient, duplicate, multi-Shop and zero-billing tests.
- [ ] Check touched production modules remain small and responsibility-focused.

## Interfaces / Contracts

Consumes `WhatsAppRecipientReachability(shopId, recipient)`, `RecoveryAdmissionBlockReason.WHATSAPP_RECIPIENT_SUPPRESSED` from DATABASE-001, and canonical recipient selection/snapshots from BACKGROUND-005. Produces bounded `allow/suppressed(until)` admission outcomes; it does not write failure or success reachability evidence.

## Dependencies

- `ARCH-028-DATABASE-001`
- `ARCH-028-BACKGROUND-005`

## Enables

- `ARCH-028-BACKGROUND-011`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Active suppression never causes a billable admission or provider call.
- [ ] A different Shop or recipient is not blocked by another reachability key.
- [ ] Expired suppression is re-evaluated safely; stale/duplicate resume cannot double-charge.
- [ ] No new runtime source file exceeds 300 lines, and large existing source files receive only bounded wiring.

## Validation

Focused unit/integration/PostgreSQL checks for suppression, expiry/resume, concurrency, initial/follow-up zero-charge behaviour; repository-declared Background tests/build and `git diff --check`.

## Stop Condition

Complete defined work/acceptance/validation, fill the Completion Report, set status `review`, return to `moda_architect`, and STOP. Do not begin a dependent task.

## Implementation Notes

Keep the gate a thin reusable Background capability rather than mixing persistence writers, compensation and queue orchestration into one service. Do not log the full canonical phone number.
