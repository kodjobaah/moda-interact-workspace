# Extract order completion recovery correlation

## Architecture

Architecture ID: `ARCH-025`

Architecture document: `docs/architecture/ARCH-025-shopify-billing-service-maintainability.md`

Coordinator: `moda_architect`

## Objective

Extract order completion correlation into a bounded service preserving checkout/cart identity rules, pending-candidate cancellation, transient order tombstones and atomic recovery completion/status history.

## Context

Order completion is a distinct race-sensitive lifecycle with strong existing regression coverage. It serializes against candidate materialisation on the checkout key, cancels a matched candidate before durable recovery work, records the order-processed tombstone outside the Prisma completion transaction, and only completes an eligible existing recovery.

## Scope

Authorised implementation surface:

```text
src/services/checkout-recovery.service.ts
src/services/checkout-recovery/order-recovery-correlation.service.ts
tests/unit/services/checkout-recovery/order-recovery-correlation.service.test.ts
```

A directly adjacent repository-internal types file is permitted only where required to keep the extracted capability coherent.

## Out of Scope

candidate-service internals; materialisation; checkout/cart events; outreach; capacity resume; schema/order persistence redesign.

## Requirements

### Common ARCH-025 CheckoutRecovery invariants

- This is a **move-only structural refactor**. Do not change recovery eligibility, outreach policy, billing/capacity economics, candidate/order correlation, queue identity, provider protocol, retry behaviour, authorization, durable lifecycle semantics or CommerceAgent context meaning.
- Preserve the exact compatibility surface from `src/services/checkout-recovery.service.ts`: `CheckoutRecoveryService`, `checkoutRecoveryService`, `MaturedCandidateMaterializationResult`, `CheckoutRefreshResult`, and every current public method: `handleCheckoutCreatedContract`, `materializeMaturedCandidate`, `recordExternalActivity`, `handleCheckoutUpdatedContract`, `handleCartActivityContract`, `handleOrderCompletedContract`, `upsertRecovery`, `attachCustomer`, `resolveRecipient`, `markRecoveryMessageSent`, `handleOrderCompleted`, `handleCheckoutCreated`, `processRecoveryOutreachFollowUp`, `markRecoveryCapacityBlocked`, `resumeCapacityBlockedRecovery`, `getAgentContext`, `getAgentContextForStandaloneConversation`.
- Preserve the constructor `(billingService: RecoveryBillingService = recoveryBillingService)`. Existing workers and Commerce callers continue using the `checkoutRecoveryService` singleton; do not migrate worker entrypoints/callers as part of extraction.
- Extracted modules MUST NOT import `checkout-recovery.service.ts`; dependency direction is façade -> collaborator. Symbols moved out of the façade that are currently exported must be compatibility re-exported from it.
- Collaborator constructors are inert wiring only. Do not perform Prisma/provider/Redis/queue/environment I/O or eager model access during construction.
- Any extracted collaborator that performs recovery billing MUST receive and reuse the exact `RecoveryBillingService` instance supplied to the `CheckoutRecoveryService` constructor. Do not silently fall back to the module singleton when a caller supplied a test/custom billing service.
- Continue reusing canonical owners: `RecoveryBillingService`, `RecoveryOutreachAttemptService`, `recoveryOutreachFollowUpService`, `RecoveryPolicyService`, `PendingRecoveryCandidateService`, `ShopExecutionEligibilityService`, `AbandonedCheckoutLookupService`, `RecoveryCapacityResumeService`, `OutboundWhatsAppAdmissionService`, `ConversationService`, `ConversationMessageService`, and `WhatsAppTemplateSelectorService`. Do not duplicate their logic.
- There remains exactly one outbound WhatsApp provider path through `OutboundWhatsAppAdmissionService`; do not create a direct Meta/provider send workflow. Deterministic outreach idempotency remains `recovery-outreach:<attemptId>`.
- Preserve all provider/network versus Prisma transaction boundaries, checkout-scoped lock boundaries, order-processed tombstone timing, status-guarded `updateMany` predicates, generation ordering and post-commit queue/provider ordering exactly. Do not move external calls into a Prisma transaction.
- Preserve stale/duplicate replay behaviour and terminal-state non-reopening. Do not convert durable capacity blocking into in-memory state.
- Preserve current data-source trust: webhook candidate/update basket/customer fields must not become durable recovery snapshot data where current Shopify lookup is authoritative.
- Preserve the integrated ARCH-024 `RecoveryAgentContext` contract: canonical `shopId`, shop domain, conversation ownership checks, language metadata and bounded history/current-message semantics.
- Do not introduce a new generic logger. If diagnostics are added, use the canonical Shared structured logger and bounded identifiers only; do not log whole checkout/customer/provider/message payloads.
- These post-ARCH-024 regression assets are frozen and MUST remain byte-for-byte unchanged:
  - `tests/unit/services/matured-candidate.materialization.test.ts` — SHA-256 `28d629008a63e3fc554dd15bd268c52a73287169832f40f63f5d02c0c3bcafcb`
  - `tests/unit/services/checkout-refresh.test.ts` — SHA-256 `3330367841b6a35e5cdb15c6f8619b529b74336834da8c307d66c16e3202a36f`
  - `tests/unit/services/order-recovery-correlation.test.ts` — SHA-256 `7b3d3020f822ee1bc514de7aee9f15245f3d86cd6dacd6fee6b1f892a6516dbf`
  - `tests/unit/services/checkout-recovery.capacity-resume.test.ts` — SHA-256 `8c11db2f98681899742579db2766527ec5f26b5dfdf15a264551eecea9a115e1`
- Add separate focused tests for each extracted owner. Do not move assertions out of frozen files, skip tests, weaken assertions or change expected behaviour to make an extraction pass.
- Full `npm test` must introduce no regression. If a synchronized baseline failure exists, follow the durable baseline protocol; do not silently redefine expected failures inside the task.

### R1 — correlation safety

Move the repository-internal `RecoveryOrderCompletionInput` shape with the order-correlation owner while keeping `handleOrderCompleted(...)` compatible through the façade.

Customer identity alone remains insufficient. Missing checkout+cart correlation returns `ignored/missing-correlation`. Preserve the current shop gate exactly: resolve `{ id, status }` by domain and proceed when the Shop itself is `ACTIVE`; do **not** replace this with `ShopExecutionEligibilityService` subscription gating. Order completion is terminal safety bookkeeping and must continue for an ACTIVE Shop even when its subscription is FROZEN. Cart-only orders first resolve the indexed candidate solely to recover checkout scope; if none exists they remain `discarded/no-checkout-token`.

### R2 — checkout serialization and tombstone order

Retain `withCheckoutLock(shopId, checkoutToken)` before candidate cancellation/recovery completion. Inside the lock, resolve candidate first. If found, cancel it, then mark the order processed and return `cancelled-candidate`. If not found and a checkout token exists, mark the order processed **before** the Prisma recovery transaction so in-flight materialisation is suppressed. Do not move the tombstone into PostgreSQL.

### R3 — durable completion

The Prisma transaction continues to load the latest recovery by generation/id, ignore terminal `COMPLETED/EXPIRED/CANCELLED`, CAS-update only `DETECTED/MESSAGE_SENT/ENGAGED` to `COMPLETED`, clear admission block fields and create status history in the same transaction. Preserve event completion timestamp fallback and metadata/source strings exactly.

### R4 — no new durable order model

Do not persist unrelated orders or introduce schema/state solely for this refactor.

## Work Items

- [ ] Extract order correlation and adapt `handleOrderCompletedContract`/`handleOrderCompleted` façade delegates.
- [ ] Preserve checkout lock/tombstone/transaction order exactly.
- [ ] Add focused tests for checkout and cart correlation, candidate cancellation, terminal/idempotent completion and tombstone-without-recovery.
- [ ] Prove frozen order suite remains byte-identical and passes.

## Interfaces / Contracts

Repository-internal extraction only. The public worker/application contract remains `CheckoutRecoveryService` / `checkoutRecoveryService`; canonical adjacent service contracts are consumed rather than redefined.

## Stop Condition

After the defined Work Items, Acceptance Criteria and required Validation are complete, set the task to `review`, finish the Completion Report, return control to `moda_architect` and **STOP**. Do not begin the enabled or adjacent ARCH-025 Background task.
