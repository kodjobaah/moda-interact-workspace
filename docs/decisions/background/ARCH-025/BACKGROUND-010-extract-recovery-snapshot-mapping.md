# Extract canonical recovery snapshot mapping

## Architecture

Architecture ID: `ARCH-025`

Architecture document: `docs/architecture/ARCH-025-shopify-billing-service-maintainability.md`

Coordinator: `moda_architect`

## Objective

Extract the canonical current-Shopify-to-RecoveryCheckoutSeed mapping and international-context resolution so materialisation, refresh and capacity resume reuse one exact snapshot shape without changing source precedence.

## Context

`toRecoverySeed(...)`, `resolveInternationalContext(...)`, `serializeLineItems(...)` and `safelyNormalize(...)` encode the durable recovery snapshot shape used by candidate materialisation and capacity resume, while checkout refresh reuses the line-item mapping. This is a stable prerequisite for moving those lifecycle handlers without duplicating mapping rules.

## Scope

Authorised implementation surface:

```text
src/services/checkout-recovery.service.ts
src/services/checkout-recovery/recovery-snapshot-builder.service.ts
src/services/checkout-recovery/recovery-mappers.ts
tests/unit/services/checkout-recovery/recovery-snapshot-builder.service.test.ts
```

A directly adjacent repository-internal types file is permitted only where required to keep the extracted capability coherent.

## Out of Scope

candidate lifecycle decisions; provider lookup; initiation; checkout refresh lifecycle; capacity resume lifecycle; changes to Shopify normalized checkout contracts.

## Requirements

### Common ARCH-025 CheckoutRecovery invariants

- This is a **move-only structural refactor**. Do not change recovery eligibility, outreach policy, billing/capacity economics, candidate/order correlation, queue identity, provider protocol, retry behaviour, authorization, durable lifecycle semantics or CommerceAgent context meaning.
- Preserve the exact compatibility surface from `src/services/checkout-recovery.service.ts`: `CheckoutRecoveryService`, `checkoutRecoveryService`, `MaturedCandidateMaterializationResult`, `CheckoutRefreshResult`, and every current public method: `handleCheckoutCreatedContract`, `materializeMaturedCandidate`, `recordExternalActivity`, `handleCheckoutUpdatedContract`, `handleCartActivityContract`, `handleOrderCompletedContract`, `upsertRecovery`, `attachCustomer`, `resolveRecipient`, `markRecoveryMessageSent`, `handleOrderCompleted`, `handleCheckoutCreated`, `processRecoveryOutreachFollowUp`, `markRecoveryCapacityBlocked`, `resumeCapacityBlockedRecovery`, `getAgentContext`, `getAgentContextForStandaloneConversation`.
- Preserve the constructor `(billingService: RecoveryBillingService = recoveryBillingService)`. Existing workers and Commerce callers continue using the `checkoutRecoveryService` singleton; do not migrate worker entrypoints/callers as part of extraction.
- Extracted modules MUST NOT import `checkout-recovery.service.ts`; dependency direction is façade -> collaborator. Symbols moved out of the façade that are currently exported must be compatibility re-exported from it.
- Collaborator constructors are inert wiring only. Do not perform Prisma/provider/Redis/queue/environment I/O or eager model access during construction.
- Any extracted collaborator that performs recovery billing MUST receive and reuse the exact `RecoveryBillingService` instance supplied to the `CheckoutRecoveryService` constructor. Do not silently fall back to the module singleton when a caller supplied a test/custom billing service.
- Continue reusing canonical owners: `RecoveryBillingService`, `RecoveryOutreachAttemptService`, `recoveryOutreachFollowUpService`, `RecoveryPolicyService`, `PendingRecoveryCandidateService`, `ShopExecutionEligibilityService`, `AbandonedCheckoutLookupService`, `RecoveryCapacityResumeService`, `OutboundWhatsAppAdmissionService`, `ConversationService`, `ConversationMessageService`, and `WhatsAppTemplateSelectorService`. Do not duplicate their logic.
- There remains exactly one outbound WhatsApp provider path through `OutboundWhatsAppAdmissionService`; do not create a direct Meta/provider send workflow. Deterministic outreach idempotency remains `recovery-outreach:<attemptId>`.
- Preserve all provider/network versus Prisma transaction boundaries, checkout-scoped lock boundaries, order-processed tombstone timing, status-guarded `updateMany` predicates, generation ordering and post-commit queue/provider ordering exactly. Do not move external calls into a Prisma transaction.
- Preserve stale/duplicate replay behaviour and terminal-state non-reopening. Do not convert durable capacity blocking into in-memory state.
- Preserve current data-source trust: webhook candidate/update basket/customer fields must not become durable recovery snapshot data where current Shopify lookup is authoritative.
- Preserve the integrated ARCH-024 `RecoveryAgentContext` contract: canonical `shopId`, shop domain, conversation ownership checks, language metadata and bounded history/current-message semantics.
- Do not introduce a new generic logger. If diagnostics are added, use the canonical Shared structured logger and bounded identifiers only; do not log whole checkout/customer/provider/message payloads.
- These post-ARCH-024 regression assets are frozen and MUST remain byte-for-byte unchanged:
  - `tests/unit/services/matured-candidate.materialization.test.ts` — SHA-256 `28d629008a63e3fc554dd15bd268c52a73287169832f40f63f5d02c0c3bcafcb`
  - `tests/unit/services/checkout-refresh.test.ts` — SHA-256 `3330367841b6a35e5cdb15c6f8619b529b74336834da8c307d66c16e3202a36f`
  - `tests/unit/services/order-recovery-correlation.test.ts` — SHA-256 `7b3d3020f822ee1bc514de7aee9f15245f3d86cd6dacd6fee6b1f892a6516dbf`
  - `tests/unit/services/checkout-recovery.capacity-resume.test.ts` — SHA-256 `8c11db2f98681899742579db2766527ec5f26b5dfdf15a264551eecea9a115e1`
- Add separate focused tests for each extracted owner. Do not move assertions out of frozen files, skip tests, weaken assertions or change expected behaviour to make an extraction pass.
- Full `npm test` must introduce no regression. If a synchronized baseline failure exists, follow the durable baseline protocol; do not silently redefine expected failures inside the task.

### R1 — exact durable seed shape

Preserve current seed fields and source ownership. Candidate contributes correlation/timing context only; current `NormalizedAbandonedCheckout` owns customer, basket, price, currency and recovery URL. Line-item JSON fields remain exactly `productId`, `variantId`, `title`, `variantTitle`, `sku`, `quantity`, `price`.

### R2 — preserve timestamp precedence

`detectedAt` remains `checkout.createdAt || candidate.checkoutCreatedAt || new Date().toISOString()`. `lastExternalActivityAt` is included only when candidate activity exists. Do not normalize these clock semantics as part of extraction.

### R3 — preserve international-context precedence exactly

Preserve the current, non-obvious behaviour rather than "fixing" it:

- `languageTag` comes only from normalized merchant `defaultLanguageTag`; current/event language tags are not selected here;
- `languageSource` is `merchant-default` iff that normalized merchant language exists, otherwise null;
- country: current Shopify -> event -> normalized merchant default;
- currency: current Shopify -> event -> null;
- time zone: current Shopify -> event -> normalized merchant default;
- invalid merchant defaults normalize to null rather than throw.

The one merchant settings read remains outside provider calls/transactions.

### R4 — reusable pure mapper

Keep line-item and seed-shaping code domain-specific. Do not create a generic mapping/plugin framework.

## Work Items

- [ ] Extract snapshot builder and pure recovery mappers.
- [ ] Replace existing callers with the same mapping boundary without changing lifecycle decisions.
- [ ] Add focused precedence/invalid-default/line-item/timestamp tests.
- [ ] Prove hostile or stale candidate basket/customer fields still cannot populate durable recovery state.
- [ ] Prove frozen assets remain byte-identical and pass.

## Interfaces / Contracts

Repository-internal extraction only. The public worker/application contract remains `CheckoutRecoveryService` / `checkoutRecoveryService`; canonical adjacent service contracts are consumed rather than redefined.

## Dependencies

- `ARCH-025-BACKGROUND-009`

## Enables

- `ARCH-025-BACKGROUND-011`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] One canonical mapping owner produces the same durable RecoveryCheckoutSeed shape.
- [ ] Internationalization/source precedence is unchanged exactly.
- [ ] No provider/database lifecycle semantics move into the mapping module.
- [ ] Later materialisation/capacity/refresh tasks can consume the mapping without importing the façade.

## Validation

- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] `git diff --check` passes
- [ ] `npm test -- tests/unit/services/checkout-recovery/recovery-snapshot-builder.service.test.ts` passes

## Stop Condition
