## Current execution highlights

- `ARCH-010`: first-production baseline consolidation is current. Ready frontier: `BACKGROUND-008`, `BACKGROUND-009`, `ADMIN-004`, `ADMIN-008`. `DATABASE-014` and `ADMIN-010` are architect-accepted Complete; superseded tasks remain history only.
- `ARCH-010` system-test tasks remain terminal/manual-gated and never block implementation startup.
- For architectures other than ARCH-010, use [`WORKSPACE-CURRENT-TASK-STATE.md`](WORKSPACE-CURRENT-TASK-STATE.md) plus individual task YAML rather than relying on an old highlight bullet.

- `ARCH-012`: agreed Moda-managed WhatsApp communications. Ready frontier: `SHARED-001`, `DATABASE-001`, `BACKGROUND-003`. Exact task YAML and `ARCH-012-implementation-handoff.md` are authoritative.

- `ARCH-013`: implemented. `SHOPIFY-001` is Complete / Attempt 2 Accepted and `SHOPIFY-002` is Complete / Attempt 1 Accepted. ARCH-013 has no Ready task; the routing-coherence gate before later billing-v1.1 work is satisfied.

## Historical architecture material

Files named `*-review-*`, `*-amendment.md`, overview documents, and old overlay/patch artifacts may intentionally preserve earlier decisions or task frontiers. Use the current-state rollup and task YAML for execution eligibility.

## ARCH-019 — merchant recovery experience (2026-09-20)

Current frontier: all ARCH-019 implementation tasks are architect-accepted/Complete: DATABASE-001 and SHOPIFY-001/003/006 at Attempt 1, SHOPIFY-002 at Attempt 3, SHOPIFY-004/005 at Attempt 2. SHOPIFY-006 accepted `39054cec`. SYSTEM-TEST-001 Ready at Attempt 0, explicitly developer-invoked after manual validation; not started. Architecture remains In Progress pending terminal integrated validation and final architect acceptance. Accepted dependency records are reconciled into SYSTEM-TEST-001; readiness does not authorize execution, deployment or unmerged dependency consumption.

## ARCH-020 — CommerceAgent Studio and MCP capabilities (2026-09-20)

COMMERCE-001 is architect-accepted Complete at Attempt 3 (`d7c1c65`). The descendant-process cleanup correction passed focused functional validation; prior real Docker PostgreSQL/Redis readiness evidence is retained. COMMERCE-002 is architect-accepted Complete at Attempt 2 (`fb3362e`): development HTTP mutations and revoked-session recovery are corrected. Live Google OAuth remains developer-owned deployment validation. Downstream source consumption awaits developer integration or explicit accepted-commit approval; no task is promoted or launched. COMMERCE-001 remains accepted and integrated. Other task rows retain this branch snapshot; canonical task worktrees remain authoritative.

The Commerce repository and nested database are provisioned; live MCP remains private and staff UI routing remains Gateway-owned. This task review does not complete ARCH-020.

## Shopify merchant preferences acceptance — 2026-09-20

SHOPIFY-001 is architect-accepted Complete at Attempt 1 (`4693bba`, report
`c5016d73`). Merchant eligibility, explicit idempotent saves and guarded form
behavior conform; architect reran 18 passing focused checks and reviewed six
passing PostgreSQL tests plus build/browser evidence. Existing repository-wide
typecheck/lint limitations remain documented. SYSTEM-TEST-001 remains Pending
until all its implementation dependencies are accepted, then explicitly
user-invoked; no task is launched. Developer integration remains separate.

Historical pre-acceptance snapshot: 19 tasks, 4 Complete, 1 Ready, 14 Pending; superseded for BACKGROUND-001 by the Attempt 3 acceptance below.
Other canonical task worktrees remain authoritative for concurrent progress;
this review does not overwrite their state. Prior readiness records are historical.

## BACKGROUND-001 Attempt 3 architect acceptance — 2026-09-20

ARCH-020-BACKGROUND-001 is **Accepted / Complete, Attempt 3**, implementation
`4e42056`, report `7a3cf35d`. R1/R2 are resolved: persisted inbound ordering
replaces completion-time comparisons, and finishing an earlier reply does not
discard valid pending audio. Architect independently reran **133 passing tests**
and reviewed the submitted passing build and local real-SDK compatibility evidence.
The existing configurable OpenAI adapter and A1/A2 amendments are accepted.
Live audio-quality and PostgreSQL concurrency checks remain explicitly not run;
no deployed integration or acoustic-quality result is asserted.

This is the current decision and supersedes earlier BACKGROUND-001 Ready/Review
and Changes Requested notes. Other task states remain unchanged. BACKGROUND-002,
GATEWAY-001, COMMERCE-012 and SYSTEM-TEST-001 retain remaining dependency gates;
no dependent task is promoted or launched. Developer integration remains separate,
and ARCH-020 is not complete. See the task's latest Architect Review for limits.

## BACKGROUND-002 Attempt 4 — Accepted — 2026-09-21

ARCH-020-BACKGROUND-002 is **Accepted / Complete, Attempt 4**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `8b2f983` and report `47345f39`; architect independently
reran **114 passing focused tests**, correcting the reported combined total110.
Evidence/provenance refresh, trusted referrals and cancellation/admission guards
conform to the component contract. Latest task review distinguishes registry,
local MCP transport and injected processor evidence from unrun integrated/live
pairing. No further coverage-only correction is required for this acceptance.
Gateway002, Commerce012 and terminal system tests retain other dependencies;
no dependent is promoted or launched. Developer integration remains separate;
ARCH-020 is not complete. Earlier BACKGROUND-002 review statuses are historical.

## COMMERCE-011 Attempt 8 review — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-011 is **Ready, Attempt 8 retained**, claim cleared, not accepted.
Reviewed implementation `ae6acb4` and report `409b14a`; clean dedicated worktrees
and matching remote heads verified. All three Attempt 7 reproductions now pass;
R7-2 Redis cleanup is accepted. The sole remaining correction is R8-1: preserve
interleaved text/element order during document extraction (inline code currently
scrambles instructions). Independent focused validation: 19 passed; isolated
checks: 3 passed, 1 failed. See the latest canonical task Architect Review for
reproduction and correction scope. No dependent promotion or main integration.
Live validation remains developer-owned and is not an acceptance blocker.
This note supersedes previous COMMERCE-011 current-state wording.

## COMMERCE-011 Attempt 9 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-011 is **Complete, architect accepted, Attempt 9 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `1176412` and report `ccb35ea3`; clean dedicated worktrees
and matching remote heads verified. R8-1 inline text order is fixed; all four prior
review reproductions and 38 focused checks passed independently. Submitted full
suite remains 117/119 with two existing readiness timing failures in unchanged
code; no green full-suite or live Redis claim is made. Live Redis/OAuth/Shopify/
deployment checks remain developer-owned and pending. COMMERCE-005 is promoted
Ready (001/011/Shared Complete), with no new claim. Other dependants retain current
states because prerequisites remain unresolved. No main merge or gitlink update;
architecture is not Implemented. This supersedes older COMMERCE-011 current-state
wording while preserving historical reviews.
## COMMERCE-003 Attempt 4 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-003 is **Complete, architect accepted, Attempt 4 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `12df0104` and report `4b86771f`. The isolated rehearsal
now fails closed on unexpected SQL/cleanup errors, identifies its injected
rollback case, checks audit-backed replay and reaps owned workers. Independently
passed 26 lifecycle tests, shell syntax, four mock harness scenarios and diff
checks. Live disposable PostgreSQL execution remains explicitly developer-owned
and unrun; COMMERCE-013 owns real adapter/integration composition. No main merge
or gitlink update. COMMERCE-004 is promoted Ready (003 and SHARED-001 Complete),
without claiming an attempt. Other dependent tasks retain their current states;
012/013/system-test still have unresolved prerequisites. This acceptance supersedes
older COMMERCE-003 current-state wording; architecture is not yet Implemented.

## COMMERCE-015 Attempt 2 review — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-015 is **Ready, Attempt 2 retained**, claim cleared, not accepted.
Reviewed implementation `8793bc2` and report `b791e1c`; clean isolated worktrees
and matching remote heads verified. Working registry/auth/null-line improvements
are retained. Remaining corrections: terminal-page continuation, nullable facts
nodes, historical snapshot currency provenance, and async recovery/nested-provider
failure handling. Independent checks: 9 submitted tests passed, 5 functional
reproductions failed. See the latest task Architect Review for exact instructions.
Reported unrelated baseline failures and pending live validation are not the
review blockers. No dependent promotion, main merge or gitlink change. This note
supersedes earlier COMMERCE-015 current-state wording.

## COMMERCE-015 Attempt 3 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-015 is **Complete, architect accepted, Attempt 3 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `511e14ad` and report `a8c9a9e3`; clean dedicated worktrees
and matching remote heads verified. All five previous functional failures are
resolved: terminal-page continuation, nullable nodes, snapshot currency provenance,
post-authorization cancellation and nested provider error propagation. Independent
checks passed: 14 previous harness cases (including all five reproductions), plus
13 current focused tests and diff check. Submitted full-suite Redis timeout remains
separate; live Shopify/integration validation is still developer-owned and pending.
No dependent promotion:016 still needs006,007 needs016, and012/013/system-test have
other prerequisites. No main merge/gitlink change; architecture is not Implemented.
This acceptance supersedes all older COMMERCE-015 current-state wording.
## COMMERCE-006 Attempt 2 review — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-006 is **Ready, Attempt 2 retained**, claim cleared, not accepted.
Reviewed implementation `724875d` and report `2000bccb`; dedicated worktrees clean
and remote heads matched. Working AI/FIXED, completeness, budget and pagination
improvements are retained. Corrections remain for NONE read denial, exact
fraction-to-percentage conversion, executable list/ID query documents and positive
canonical fixed amounts. Independent checks: 16 submitted reader tests passed;
five functional reproductions failed. See the latest task Architect Review.
Live Shopify remains developer-owned and is not the blocker. No dependent
promotion or main integration. This supersedes prior COMMERCE-006 current-state
wording; the narrowed C19 reader-only scope remains authoritative.

## COMMERCE-004 Attempt 3 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-004 is **Accepted / Complete, Attempt 3 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `0411babc` and parent report `b272d1a9` against remote heads.
Original-association minima, required pinned records/current revocation, SDK
transport/protocol bounds and bounded executor waiting resolve A2-R1–A2-R3.
Independent validation passed18 focused MCP tests and all four prior failure
reproductions; diff checks passed. Submitted typecheck/lint/build passed; reported
full-suite infrastructure failures remain separate from component acceptance.
Live Background assertions, Redis, production adapter/provider and deployment
validation remain developer/integration-owned. COMMERCE-014 is promoted Ready,
Attempt0 with no claim, because004/SHARED-001 are Complete. Other dependants retain
their unresolved gates;012 is still the final implementation checkpoint.
No implementation changes, main integration or gitlink update. Architecture is not
yet Implemented. This supersedes older004 state wording and retains review history.
## COMMERCE-008 Attempt 5 review — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-008 is **Ready, Attempt 5 retained**, claim cleared, not accepted.
Reviewed implementation `558432f` and report `0b2e03bb`; remote heads matched and
worktrees were clean. A4-R2/R3 are accepted; all three previous reproductions and
25 focused tests passed independently. One remaining A5-R1 failure: adding a
nested field beneath an existing aliased product creates an unbound second root
outside the retained resultPath. The canonical task review contains exact AST
merge/validation instructions. Local U14 handoff passes; real preview integration
and live validation remain separately owned and are not blockers. No dependent
promotion or main integration. This supersedes older COMMERCE-008 state wording.

## COMMERCE-008 Attempt 6 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-008 is **Accepted / Complete, Attempt 6 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `8ba5e42` and report `7f8e194` against remote task heads.
The final alias correction preserves the existing field's arguments/result path,
rejects ambiguous edits and denies unbound duplicate roots. Independent validation:
24 focused tests and all four previous architect reproductions passed; diff checks
passed. Submitted typecheck/lint/build passed; the reported208-pass/one unrelated
Redis timeout does not block this component acceptance. Live OAuth/providers,
production composition and actual U14 execution remain separate integration work.
COMMERCE-017 is promoted Ready, Attempt0, no claim, because008/002/SHARED-001 are
accepted Complete.009 is not a prerequisite for017's contract-fixture frontend.
Other downstream tasks remain gated by their own unresolved prerequisites;012 is
still the final implementation checkpoint. No implementation changes, main merge,
main push or gitlink update. Architecture is not yet Implemented. This supersedes
older008 state wording while retaining historical reviews.

## COMMERCE-014 Attempt 1 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-014 is **Accepted / Complete, Attempt 1 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `232cbdd` and report `6dc01a40` against remote task heads.
Exact-version definition dispatch, Shared mappings/output validation, trusted-context
separation and bounded one-pass rendering satisfy the owned component contract.
Independent11 focused tests and diff checks passed. Lint/typecheck/build and wider
suite results remain submitted evidence.013 owns real adapter registration and
integrated policy/query execution; live infrastructure/evidence validation remains
separate. No dependent promotion, new claim, implementation edit, main integration
or gitlink update.012 remains the final implementation checkpoint; architecture is
not yet Implemented. Older014 readiness wording is historical.
## COMMERCE-016 Attempt 1 architect review — 2026-09-21

Changes Requested; Ready, Attempt 1 retained, claim cleared; not accepted.
Reviewed implementation `bfbd7839` and report `f96b41df` against remote task heads.
Independent submitted contract suites passed50/50; three isolated functional
reproductions fail: unknown current basket variant facts still qualify, a LINE
rounding cap understates100% savings, and mixed-currency proposal amounts produce
a false known subtotal failure. R1–R3 give explicit evaluator corrections and
expected outputs in the task report. Pure arithmetic/Shared evidence and shared
budget boundaries are retained. No implementation edits, next claim, main merge,
gitlink update or dependent promotion.007 remains gated by016;013 and012 retain
their remaining gates. Live provider composition remains separate integration work.
Older readiness wording is historical; architecture is not yet Implemented.
## COMMERCE-005 Attempt 4 accepted — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-005 is **Accepted / Complete, Attempt 4 retained**, claim cleared.
Reviewed implementation `f099659` and report `e5662be5` against remote heads.
A3-R1 is resolved: rejected/late body cleanup no longer delays typed responses;
cleanup rejections are observed; only Uint8Array/ReadableStream bodies are supported,
and unsupported iterators are rejected without consumption. Existing stream and
query corrections remain. Independent13 focused tests and the prior pending-cleanup
reproduction passed; diff checks passed. Typecheck/lint/build and full272/275 are
submitted evidence; baseline failures do not block this component acceptance.
013 owns real transport composition; live Shopify/provider validation remains
pending. No dependent promotion, new claim, main integration or gitlink update.
012 remains the final implementation checkpoint; architecture is not yet Implemented.
This supersedes older005 current-state wording while preserving review history.

## COMMERCE-007 Attempt 1 architect review — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-007 is **Changes Requested / Ready, Attempt 1 retained**, executor and
claimed_at null; not accepted. Reviewed implementation `6821a49` and parent report
`a67becf`, matching remote task heads. Independent focused tests passed 6/6;
five functional reproductions failed: cheapest candidate omitted before evaluation,
duplicate proposals returned, evaluator DENIED converted to OK, cross-currency
replacement emitted, and unknown quantity defaulted to 1. The task's A1-R1–R3
specify exact correction steps and effects; A1-R4 preserves COMMERCE-007's existing local C18
producer-fixture ownership and separates real system/provider validation.
No new claim, dependent promotion, implementation change, main integration or
gitlink update. COMMERCE-010/013 remain gated by COMMERCE-007 acceptance and their remaining
prerequisites. This supersedes older COMMERCE-007 current-state wording only; other task
reviews and dependency states are preserved. Architecture is not yet Implemented.

## COMMERCE-007 Attempt 4 architect review — 2026-09-21

COMMERCE-007 is **Changes Requested / Ready, Attempt 4 retained**, claims cleared.
Reviewed implementation `91faf18` and report `cb8f7f3` against remote task heads.
Independent 11 focused tests and seven prior runtime reproductions pass; no new
production defect is alleged. Two harness diagnostics fail: its exhausted-budget
case issues zero provider requests, and its consumer accepts an invalid selected
second evidence item. A4-R1 specifies the remaining A3-R1 harness/report correction:
real nested budget work, measured replay callbacks, validation of every selected
item, isolated valid negative fixtures and accurate report claims. Runtime fixes
remain verified. No dependent promotion, new claim, implementation change, main
integration or gitlink update. Deployed MCP/worker/Shopify evidence stays pending
with its assigned owner. This supersedes older COMMERCE-007 current-state wording only;
other task decisions remain unchanged and architecture is not yet Implemented.
