## Current execution highlights

- `ARCH-010`: first-production baseline consolidation is current. Ready frontier: `BACKGROUND-008`, `BACKGROUND-009`, `ADMIN-004`, `ADMIN-008`. `DATABASE-014` and `ADMIN-010` are architect-accepted Complete; superseded tasks remain history only.
- `ARCH-010` system-test tasks remain terminal/manual-gated and never block implementation startup.
- For architectures other than ARCH-010, use [`WORKSPACE-CURRENT-TASK-STATE.md`](WORKSPACE-CURRENT-TASK-STATE.md) plus individual task YAML rather than relying on an old highlight bullet.

- `ARCH-012`: agreed Moda-managed WhatsApp communications. Ready frontier: `SHARED-001`, `DATABASE-001`, `BACKGROUND-003`. Exact task YAML and `ARCH-012-implementation-handoff.md` are authoritative.

- `ARCH-013`: implemented. `SHOPIFY-001` is Complete / Attempt 2 Accepted and `SHOPIFY-002` is Complete / Attempt 1 Accepted. ARCH-013 has no Ready task; the routing-coherence gate before later billing-v1.1 work is satisfied.

## Historical architecture material

Files named `*-review-*`, `*-amendment.md`, overview documents, and old overlay/patch artifacts may intentionally preserve earlier decisions or task frontiers. Use the current-state rollup and task YAML for execution eligibility.

## ARCH-019 — merchant recovery experience (2026-09-20)

Current frontier: all ARCH-019 implementation tasks are architect-accepted/Complete: DATABASE-001 and SHOPIFY-001/003/006 at Attempt 1, SHOPIFY-002 at Attempt 3, SHOPIFY-004/005 at Attempt 2. SHOPIFY-006 accepted `39054cec`. SYSTEM-TEST-001 Ready at Attempt 0, explicitly developer-invoked after manual validation; not started. Architecture remains In Progress pending terminal integrated validation and final architect acceptance. Accepted dependency records are reconciled into SYSTEM-TEST-001; readiness does not authorize execution, deployment or unmerged dependency consumption.

## ARCH-020 — CommerceAgent Studio and MCP capabilities (2026-09-20)

COMMERCE-001 is architect-accepted Complete at Attempt 3 (`d7c1c65`). The descendant-process cleanup correction passed focused functional validation; prior real Docker PostgreSQL/Redis readiness evidence is retained. COMMERCE-002 has satisfied its task dependency but remains Pending until developer integration or explicit accepted-commit consumption. No downstream task is launched or promoted. Other task rows retain this branch snapshot; canonical task worktrees remain authoritative.

The Commerce repository and nested database are provisioned; live MCP remains private and staff UI routing remains Gateway-owned. This task review does not complete ARCH-020.
